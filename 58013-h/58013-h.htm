<p class="center xxlargefont">The Dreadnought Boys On a<br />
Submarine.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">UNCLE SAM GETS FIRST CALL.</span></h2>


<p>“So your final answer is no?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And with a big N, Mr. Ferriss. I
have put my best work of head and hand into
the Lockyer submarine, and Uncle Sam gets
first call on her services.”</p>

<p>“You remind me of a copy book with your
sentimental morality,” sneered Jasper Ferriss,
with the bitter inflection of a man who has
fought a losing fight and knows it.</p>

<p>“Why,” he went on persuasively, “you know
as well as I do that the government is notoriously
slow pay. By the time the red tape is unwound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
at Washington you’ll be penniless, and the boat
a rust-eaten wreck. Our concern, on the other
hand, offers you a fat figure, down on the nail.
Come, say the word and I’ll write you a check
now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself, Mr. Ferriss,” smiled
Channing Lockyer, as the other’s be-diamonded
hand sought his breast pocket to produce his
check book&mdash;the magic volume which could have
told many tales of its adventures with Jasper
Ferriss.</p>

<p>“My answer to you and your concern regarding
your proposition is <em>No</em>,&mdash;first, last and all
the time,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Jasper Ferriss was angered. Despite his experience
and skill in putting through all manner
of “deals” requiring the exercise of the nicest
diplomacy, he could not help showing his chagrin.
He showed it in the way his black brows contracted
till they met in one thick band across his
puffy, florid countenance. Showed it, too, in the
quick way in which he rubbed his blue, clean-shaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
chin, with its triple folds of fat, and in
the sharp, impatient beat of his patent leather
boot on the floor of the dusty shipyard office in
which they sat talking by Channing Lockyer’s
battered old desk, with its litter of blueprints
and plans.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The question was shot out as if it had been a
projectile.</p>

<p>“Why?” echoed Channing Lockyer. “Because
your firm proposes to build submarines of
my type for a foreign power&mdash;a power that may
some day be at war with us. I believe&mdash;it may
be an inventor’s conceited folly&mdash;but I believe
that with a fleet of Lockyer submarines the
power controlling them will be absolute mistress
of the seas. Naturally, as a descendant of Jefferson
Lockyer, I don’t want to see any country but
my own with such powerful engines of war at
its disposal.”</p>

<p>The confidence of inventors in their works
was not new to Jasper Ferriss. But somehow
the enthusiasm of this tall, pale young man, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the workman’s clothes and the long, nervous
fingers, infected him. But it made him burn
with an ardent desire to secure possession of the
secret of the Lockyer submarine for his own
company. However, while Channing Lockyer
had been talking the other had managed to control
his irritation, and now could speak with his
accustomed smoothness.</p>

<p>“I understand and honor your feelings, Mr.
Lockyer,” he said suavely, “but a man’s first
duty is really to himself, especially to a man in
your position. But when is the government going
to test your craft?”</p>

<p>It was an old trick of Jasper Ferriss’s to abruptly
change the subject when things weren’t
going his way.</p>

<p>“I am expecting the officer who will be in
charge of the experiments, and his picked crew,
within a few days,” was the reply. “A short
time will be spent in making them familiar with
the construction, and then, after she is launched,
we shall go ahead with the real tests.”</p>

<p>“And the launching will be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as possible. But there will be no
public ceremony. Only the workmen, who are
pledged to secrecy, will know if she is a success
or a failure. Naturally we wish to keep it all as
quiet as possible.”</p>

<p>“The men are still working on her?”</p>

<p>The question seemed hardly necessary.
Through the open windows there floated the busy
sounds of activity from the fenced-in yard.
From a tall, narrow shed built against the seaward
side of the high fence came the loudest
demonstration of activity.</p>

<p>A rattling volley of riveters’ hammers, accompanied
by the snorting snarl of the whirring
pneumatic drills eating through steel plates, was
punctuated by shouted orders and the clamor of
metal on metal.</p>

<p>“We are putting on the finishing touches,”
explained Lockyer. He sighed as he spoke. The
“finishing touches” he referred to might mean
the last strokes of his own career as well as the
end of the preliminary stages of the submarine’s
construction. Ferriss’s eyes followed the tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
slender young form as the youthful inventor
strode up and down the tiny office, with its
tumble-down, dust-covered desks, their pigeon-holes
crammed full of blueprints and working
drawings. No gilt and gingerbread about Channing
Lockyer’s office. It was business-like as a
steam hammer.</p>

<p>“Looks soft as rubber,” mused Ferriss, “but
he’s tough as Harveyized steel; and a blessed
sight less workable.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lockyer,” he went on, rising, “I
must be going. But I am stopping in the village,
recollect, so that if you change your mind, or
Uncle Sam doesn’t appreciate the boat, we stand
ready to negotiate for her.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” laughed the inventor, “but
really, Mr. Ferriss, you are wasting your time.
Either the United States gets her, or, if she isn’t
good enough for Uncle Sam, I’ll sink her to the
bottom of Long Island Sound.”</p>

<p>“Fine talk! Fine talk!” chuckled the amiable
Mr. Ferriss, as he stepped into the noisy, bustling
yard, so effectually cut off from outside observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by its high fence with the spikes on top.
“But our figures will look mighty comfortable to
you when you are on the brink of ruin. And you
will be if the Lockyer doesn’t come up to government
requirements.”</p>

<p>“Time enough to talk about that when the
crash comes,” laughed the young inventor gaily
enough. But as Ferriss’s portly, expensively
dressed form vanished through the door he sank
into a chair, and sat staring at the opposite wall,
deep in thought. Things were coming to a crisis
at the Lockyer boatyard.</p>

<p>Channing Lockyer was in his twenty-fifth
year. Just twelve months before this story opens
he had been left a considerable fortune by his
father, who during his lifetime had done all he
could to discourage his son’s “fantastic mechanical
dreams,” as he called them. With the money
in his possession, however, young Lockyer, with
the true fire of the inventor, had started out to
realize his fondest hope, namely to build a practicable
submarine boat capable of making extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cruises without the drawback of the accompanying
“parent boat.”</p>

<p>Compressed air had solved the problem of
running his engines, but the use of the new driving
force had necessitated the invention of an
entirely novel type of motor. But young Lockyer&mdash;a
graduate of the Sheffield Scientific
School of Yale, by the way&mdash;had perseveringly
overcome all difficulties, and now, in the long,
narrow shed over in one corner of the enclosed
yard, stood the realization of his dreams.
Through some friends of his late father’s the
young man had succeeded in “pulling the wires”
at Washington. As a consequence, after many
wearisome delays, Lieutenant Archer Parry and
a picked crew were to be sent to Grayport to
make an extended series of tests with the new
craft.</p>

<p>But in “pulling his wires” Lockyer had necessarily
to allow a part of his secret to leak out.
Now, at Washington “walls have ears,” and it
was not long after he received the glad news
that at last the Navy Department had decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
look into his type of boat, that Jasper Ferriss, promoter
and partner in the Atlas Submarine Company,
had come to young Lockyer with a proposal
to sell his plant, stock, and experimental
boat outright, for a sum that fairly staggered
the inventor, who had, as Ferriss had hinted,
run through almost his entire fortune in making
his experiments.</p>

<p>Now, Lockyer was not ignorant that the Atlas
people, having failed to sell their own gasolene
and electric-driven boats to the government, were
making diving torpedo boats for a certain Far
Eastern power. He came of old Revolutionary
stock, and the idea of selling his boat, the offspring
of his brain and inventive power, for possible
use against his own country was absolutely
repugnant to him; wherefore Lockyer, as we have
seen, had informed the Atlas concern in no uncertain
terms that he would have nothing to do
with their offers, flattering though they might
seem. Jasper Ferriss had, however, perseveringly
hung on, hoping against hope that something
might happen to make the inventor change his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mind. The news he had just received that a
naval experimental force had actually been ordered
to start for Grayport came as a rude shock
to him.</p>

<p>In fact, after leaving Channing Lockyer, Mr.
Ferriss took the first train to New York. In the
Broadway offices of his firm a stormy scene followed
his narrative of his failure to close a deal
with Lockyer.</p>

<p>Camberly&mdash;Watson Camberly, the other partner
of the firm&mdash;a middle-aged man of the same
aggressive type to which Ferriss himself belonged,
took him sharply to task.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if you’ve bungled this thing
badly, Ferriss,” he growled. “You say that if
the government decides not to take the boat that
there is a chance Lockyer will accept our offer?”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to, or be ruined,” was the prompt
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got him!” cried the other, bringing
down a ponderous fist on the shiny mahogany
directors’ table of the Atlas Submarine Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” rejoined Ferriss quietly;
“from what I can gather, the boat is bound to
be an unqualified triumph. The government&mdash;although
of course I didn’t tell Lockyer so&mdash;will
jump at her.”</p>

<p>“That is if she is a success?” asked Camberly,
a peculiar light creeping into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Exactly. But, as I said, there is no doubt of
that.”</p>

<p>“Unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, unless what? You don’t mean to
cripple her, as we did the Grampus Concern
when they began to be serious rivals?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I do,” growled Camberly. “It’s
this way, Ferriss. We’ve got to have money. Our
Far Eastern friends stand ready to pay us, you
know how much, for the compressed-air boat.
Thinking that Lockyer would be easy, we practically
promised to close a deal with them. We’ve
got to have it.”</p>

<p>“In other words, Lockyer’s boat has got to fail
in her government tests?”</p>

<p>“You catch my meaning exactly,” said Camberly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a slow smile spreading over his heavy,
coarse features. “I think we had better send for
Gradbarr at once.”</p>

<p>Ferriss shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” he sighed, an almost regretful expression
coming over his face. “Lockyer is a
decent young fellow, but impracticable&mdash;quite
too fanatic in his ideas. I really wish we didn’t
have to resort to such measures, Camberly.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” rejoined the other impatiently. “Isn’t
it for his own good? We’ll pay him a bigger
price than the government would; but business is
business, and if Lockyer won’t come into camp
willingly, we’ll have to drive him.”</p>

<p>He tapped a small bell on his desk, and to the
obsequious office boy who glided in he gave a
sharp order:</p>

<p>“Send to the yard for Tom Gradbarr. Tell
him to report to me here as soon as possible.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON DECK.</span></h2>


<p>“Pardon me, is this Mr. Lockyer?”</p>

<p>It was a warm afternoon, three days after the
disgruntled Ferriss had departed, that the inventor
looked up from his desk to see, standing in
the open doorway of the office, a stalwart young
figure that almost filled the opening. Behind the
newcomer two other forms could be seen. One
was that of a lad about the same age as the youth
who had addressed him, and the other a squat,
bowlegged old fellow, with a fringe of gray
whisker running under his chin from ear to ear,
like the crescent of a new moon.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Mr. Lockyer,” rejoined the submarine
boat builder, looking up quickly at his
visitors. “Come in, won’t you? What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p>As the lad who had first spoken advanced into
the dingy office, Lockyer saw that he was a sun-bronzed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
young chap of about seventeen, dressed
quietly, but neatly, in a gray-mixture suit. His
companion, whose round, good-natured face was
crowned by a shock of red hair, was about the
same age and also wore a suit of plain but well-fitting
clothes. The third member of the party,
however, as before hinted, was a startling contrast.
His stout figure was garbed in a checked
suit, capable, at a pinch, of acting as a checker
board; a singularly small derby hat hung to one
side of his head, seemingly only being secured
from slipping off by an outstanding ear; and
round his neck was tied a silk handkerchief of
gorgeous hue. Jacob’s coat would have looked
pale and colorless in comparison with it.</p>

<p>The countenance of this gaudily apparelled
person offered a singular contrast to his violent
clothes. It was round, weather-beaten and good-natured,
the face of a hale and hearty old fellow
who has lived an outdoor life. Two blue eyes,
set deep in a mass of furrows and crow’s-feet,
twinkled brightly as he looked about him.</p>

<p>“My name is Ned Strong, boatswain’s mate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the <em>Manhattan</em>,” introduced Ned, who had been
the first to enter the office. “This is my shipmate,
Boatswain’s Mate Hercules Taylor, and
this”&mdash;turning to the spectacularly garbed old
man, “is Tom Marlin.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” rumbled old Tom, from sheer
force of habit.</p>

<p>“Why, you are some of the men who are detailed
to the trial crew that is to try out my boat,
are you not?” inquired the inventor, extending
his hand cordially as he rose from his desk.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded Ned. “We arrived a few
minutes ago, and after engaging rooms at the
hotel in the village we came down here. We
thought that Lieutenant Parry might have arrived.”</p>

<p>“Why, no. I’ve just had a wire from him saying
that he cannot get here till some time this
evening. It seems to me,” went on Mr. Lockyer,
surveying his guests with interest, “that you two
lads must be the ones the newspapers call the
‘Dreadnought Boys.’”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve occupied a good deal of valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
space to the exclusion of real news,” laughed
Ned, coloring a little.</p>

<p>“Not to mention pictures,” grinned Herc.
“They took one of me riding the ship’s goat. My
freckles came out fine&mdash;like spots on the sun.”</p>

<p>“You’ll pardon my saying that you look very
young to have distinguished yourselves so noticeably,”
said the inventor.</p>

<p>“That’s what I say, sir,” struck in old Tom,
in his deep, hoarse voice. “Why, I’ve bin in the
navy fer forty years, in wood and steel, and
nothin’ never happened to me the way it’s happened
to them lads.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was just our luck,” laughed Ned
good-naturedly; “you seem to have a splendid
plant here, Mr. Lockyer,” he went on, by way
of changing the subject. Ned was not one of
those lads who likes to “blow his own trumpet.”
Such swaggerers are usually found wanting
when the time comes to try their metal.</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ve gone into the thing pretty extensively,”
rejoined the inventor. “And now,
perhaps, as your officers have not arrived, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would like to look over the plant. Have you
ever seen a submarine before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied Ned; “though I understand
that your craft is far ahead of the ones
we are at present using. On our return from
Costaveza we were attached for a while to a
‘parent boat,’ and cruised around with the diving
craft.”</p>

<p>“My type of submarine will do away with the
parent boat,” declared Mr. Lockyer enthusiastically.
“She has a cruising range of two thousand
miles or more, if necessary. But there, you will
think all that mere inventor’s enthusiasm. Within
a week, however, I hope you will be able to see
for yourselves what she is capable of.”</p>

<p>“Jer-uso-hosophat! If you’d told me ten years
ago that we would be snoopin’ around the bottom
of the ocean in such craft, I’d not have believed
it,” declared old Tom, as they set out. “I’d
have believed you could go to the bottom, all
right; but I’d have likewise held that you’d stay
there. But sence we’ve bin detailed to submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dooty, I kin feel fins growing out o’ my shoulder
blades, I relish being under so much.”</p>

<p>“Something fishy about that!” chuckled Herc.</p>

<p>While the boys are on their way across the
busy yard let us introduce them more fully to
the reader who has not already encountered
them. Ned Strong and Herc Taylor, then, were
two lads who, orphaned at an early age, had
made their home for some years with a harsh,
unsympathetic grandparent who owned a big
farm at Lamb’s Corners, not far from Albany,
New York. They had tired of the unceasing,
monotonous round of farm duties, but could not
very well see a way out of their hum-drum existence
till one evening, in their local store, they
saw one of the navy’s recruiting posters. They
wrote for information to the Bureau of Navigation,
and soon got replies that decided them as
to their future careers. After a stormy scene
with their crabbed relative, they set out for New
York, their sole capital being some pocket money
made by the sale of skins.</p>

<p>Assigned to the new Dreadnought battleship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<em>Manhattan</em>, when they had passed their examination
in New York, they at once plunged into
some remarkable adventures. The <em>Manhattan</em>
was ordered to Guantanamo for battle practice
soon after the boys joined her. Of their experiences
and many exciting adventures the readers
can learn in the first volume of this series, “The
Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice.” Their
signal services rendered when a flare-back occurred
in a big-gun turret won them their promotions
and medals from the government. This
was only one of their many exciting and perilous
adventures.</p>

<p>After a brief furlough they once more went to
sea, this time aboard the destroyer <em>Beale</em>, which
had been ordered to duty at Costaveza, a turbulent
South American republic where a revolution
was raging. While there they were able to
distinguish themselves mightily by participating
in some stirring naval engagements. These
came about during their surprising cruise on a
Costavezan destroyer. The final downfall of
their old enemy, Hank Harkins, a ne’er-do-well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from their native village, was also related in this
volume, which is called, “The Dreadnought
Boys Aboard a Destroyer.”</p>

<p>Although they had rendered American interests
in Costaveza great service, the United States
could not reward them, as the lads had been non-combatants,
so far as theory was concerned. By
way of recompensing them, however, they had
been assigned to submarine work, the most interesting
branch of the service to-day. On this
duty they had once more encountered old Tom
Marlin, who, the reader will recall, was their
guide, philosopher and friend during their
troublous early days on the <em>Manhattan</em>. Their
commander, Captain Dunham, bearing the lads
in mind, had later detailed them, with Lieutenant
Parry, to the Lockyer secret tests. And garbed
as we have seen, in ordinary clothes, the lads and
old Tom had journeyed down to Grayport, expecting
to meet there their superior officer.</p>

<p>As they left the tool-repair shop, Mr. Lockyer
turned to Ned and remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now we will see what some folks have
called ‘Lockyer’s Dream.’”</p>

<p>He pointed to the long, narrow shed we have
already noticed. The boys’ eyes sparkled with interested
anticipation as they struck out with him
across the yard. Old Tom, however, lingered.
He had drawn out his inevitable black pipe and
tried to light it. But in the brisk wind that was
blowing he was compelled to seek the shelter of a
small shack that stood, with open door, not far
from the tool shed.</p>

<p>“Where’s your friend?” asked Mr. Lockyer,
suddenly noting Tom’s absence from the party.</p>

<p>“Why, he&mdash;&mdash;Oh, there he is!” cried Ned,
who had just noted the ends of the old tar’s necktie
floating out on the breezes as the mariner
dodged into the shed.</p>

<p>“What’s he after in there?” asked the inventor
in a sharp tone, staring back toward the shed
into which Tom had dived.</p>

<p>“He’s lighting his pipe,” exclaimed Ned, craning
his neck. “He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“WHAT!” roared the inventor in a shrill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
voice. His eyes seemed to distend and a look of
alarm came over his face.</p>

<p>Before the Dreadnought Boys knew what was
the matter he was off like a bullet from a rifle,
crossing the yard in long jumps. In a few
bounds he gained the shed, and, rushing into it,
made straight for old Tom.</p>

<p>“Look! Look out there!” he exclaimed, pointing
through the door in the boys’ direction.</p>

<p>Old Tom, somewhat astonished at the other’s
vehemence, obediently glanced in the direction
indicated. As he did so, Lockyer’s long fingers
closed over the mariner’s and he seized the match
from them and vigorously stamped it out. Then,
with a quick movement, <a id="Ref_26"></a>he caught the astonished
tar by the scruff of the neck and the slack of his
trousers, and, with a strength that the boys had
never guessed he possessed, propelled that astounded
mariner through the door and halfway
across the yard. Arrived at a panting standstill,
Mr. Lockyer seized Tom’s pipe from his mouth,
and without a word of explanation chucked it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
clear over the high board fence and out of the
place.</p>

<p>“Well! What the&mdash;&mdash;” began old Tom; but
the habit of discipline was strong upon him, and,
muffling his resentment, he turned upon Mr.
Lockyer. “Well, sir,” he began, “I don’t take
that very kindly. You might hev warned me
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Warned you!” shouted the inventor. “Great
heaven, man, it might have been too late. Do
you know what is stored inside that place where
you lit the match?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head, while the boys leaned
eagerly forward.</p>

<p>“Gun-cotton!” was the startling rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Gun-cotton!” echoed Ned. “Then Tom might
have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Blown us all to kingdom come, and the boat,
too,” declared the inventor, who had now recovered
his composure, though his face was still
pale. It was old Tom and the boys who were
shaky now.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” quavered Ned, not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
repress a shudder as he realized their narrow
escape. “But why don’t you put up some
sign,&mdash;” he asked, “something to warn any
stranger of the dangerous contents of the shed?”</p>

<p>For answer Lockyer swung the open door
closed, and they now saw clearly enough that,
emblazoned in big white letters on its outside,
was the inscription:</p>

<p>“<em>Gun-cotton! Danger!</em> Persons entering this
shed will wear felt-soled shoes.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out who left that door open,”
said the inventor grimly; “but in any event,
smoking is forbidden on these premises. It’s too
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“A good order, too,” assented Ned. But old
Tom’s face bore a lugubrious look.</p>

<p>“It’s all right for you who don’t smoke and
can’t be persuaded to, shipmates,” he muttered so
that the inventor would not hear, “but me and my
old pipe’s bin messmates fer a long time, an’ I
hate to lose it.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up. You can easily find it outside,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
comforted Herc; “but you’ll have to confine your
smoking to the evenings after this.”</p>

<p>“Reckon that’s so,” assented Tom, immensely
cheered at the thought that his pipe was not
irrevocably lost.</p>

<p>“And now we’ll continue our stroll,” said Mr.
Lockyer. “First let us visit the construction
shed, which I imagine will prove the most interesting.”</p>

<p>So saying, he struck out rapidly across the
yard, his long legs opening and closing like the
blades of a pair of scissors. They could not have
been a hundred yards from the shed when the
ground shook and there came the sound of a
muffled explosion. As the inventor came to a
sudden halt, a startled look on his face, a chorus
of excited shouts arose from within, and presently
a white-faced boy came rushing out. He
was followed by another workman and then another.
Panic seemed to have seized them. They
hardly noticed our astonished group as they
sped by.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! something has happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the boat!” gasped Mr. Lockyer, turning pale and
his slender form shaking like a leaf. He clapped
a hand to his head. In the face of the sudden
emergency he seemed crushed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WORK OF A DASTARD.</span></h2>


<p>But the inventor’s inaction did not last for
long. Like the workmen, he also started to run,
but instead of his flight being away from the
shed, it was toward it. The three man-o’-wars-men
followed close at his heels.</p>

<p>As they neared the door a hulking big fellow
lurched out, and Mr. Lockyer seized him eagerly.</p>

<p>“What is it, Gradbarr?” he demanded tremblingly.
“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“’Splosion of some sort, sir,” was the hasty
rejoinder. “Don’t go in there,” he exclaimed,
as the inventor hastily darted forward once more.
“It’s sure death.”</p>

<p>But what inventor would not dare death itself
if there was the barest chance of saving his
brain-child from harm? Shaking off the other’s
detaining grip impatiently, Lockyer entered the
shed, followed closely by Ned and his companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Curiously enough, however, Gradbarr
seemed inclined to follow, now that he had seen
the inventor enter. His first panic appeared to
have been dissipated. As old Tom’s form vanished
within, he turned and followed.</p>

<p>“Got to see they don’t find out too much,” he
muttered to himself.</p>

<p>Within the shed was intense gloom, lighted
only here and there by scattered incandescent
lights. The work being done was now all within
the hull of the submarine itself, and consequently
there was no necessity for bright illumination
without. Cutting down light bills was one of a
score of ways in which Lockyer was trying to
eke out his dwindling fortune.</p>

<p>At first nothing very much seemed to be the
matter. The gray and red painted outlines of
the submarine bulked up through the gloom like
the form of some fantastic and puffy fish. She
was shaped like a short, very fat cigar, with a
hump on the top where the conning tower, with
its big round glass lenses&mdash;like goggle eyes&mdash;projected.
A ladder was at her side, and up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this Lockyer nimbly skipped, the boys after
him.</p>

<p>As they gained the sloping deck, round which
a low iron rail ran, a peculiar odor was noticeable.
It was a sickening, pungent sort of smell,
and the boys caught themselves swallowing chokingly
as they inhaled it.</p>

<p>“Jeruso-hos-ophat, there’s bin some adult eggs
busted around here!” gasped old Tom, holding to
a hand rail on the conning tower.</p>

<p>“Smells like it,” agreed Ned. “What is it,
sir?” he inquired of Lockyer, who was hesitating
in front of the manhole which led down inside
the boat.</p>

<p>“It’s a peculiar kind of gas which I use in
starting the engines,” explained the inventor.
“How it has been liberated I cannot imagine,
but it is very volatile and must have caused the
explosion we heard.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the boat is damaged?” inquired
Herc.</p>

<p>“Impossible to say,” rejoined Lockyer nervously;
“the hull seems all right outside. Wait till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
open these ventilators and liberate the fumes,
and we’ll go inside and find out.”</p>

<p>Familiar as the boys were with submarine construction,
it was an easy task for them to aid the
inventor in unclamping the deck ventilators. The
gas rushed out in their faces, but they stepped
aside and it did not harm them. All this was
watched from the shadows of a corner of the shed
by Gradbarr.</p>

<p>“Looks like I’ve failed, after all,” he muttered,
as presently, the gas having cleared off, the inventor
decided it was safe to descend and they
entered the conning tower.</p>

<p>Stealthily as a cat, the machinist crept from his
hiding place, and, ascending the ladder, followed
them.</p>

<p>Within the conning tower the lads found themselves
upon a steel ladder with chain hand-rails,
much like what they had been accustomed to on
a man-of-war. Descending this with quick, nervous
steps, Lockyer darted for a door opening in
the bulkhead at one end of the chamber, at the
foot of the ladder, which was about ten by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
twenty feet. From this door slow, lazy curls of
smoke were coming. Thanks to the opened
ventilators, however, the interior of the submarine
was comparatively free of gases, and the
inventor unhesitatingly passed through the door.
As he did so his foot caught against a soft, yielding
object. The next instant a quick glance downward
showed him that he had tripped on the
recumbent form of a boy. In his hand the lad
clutched a wrench. Stooping swiftly, Lockyer
picked him up and bore him out into the other
chamber, where, assisted by the boys, he stretched
him upon a bench. Although the lad’s cheeks
were ghastly pale, his chest was heaving, and
presently he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness you are all right, then,
Sim!” breathed Mr. Lockyer. The lad, a slight
young chap of about sixteen, with a mop of curly
hair and large, round blue eyes, looked up at him.</p>

<p>“Did I do it, Mr. Lockyer? Did I do it?”</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked the inventor, in the indulgent
tone he might have used to one whose mind
was wandering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, turn off the gas valve. I tried to; but
I don’t know if I made good before everything
began to get wavy and it all went dark.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” said the inventor;
“I thought the gas came from a leak. Do you
mean that some one was tampering with the
valve?”</p>

<p>“I saw Gradbarr, the new man, slip into the
torpedo room, sir, while no one was looking. He
had that wrench with him. I was following him
to tell him that no one was allowed in there without
your orders, when he came running out. I
ran in to see if he had done any mischief, but
the explosion came just as I got to the valve.
I think I turned it off, though.”</p>

<p>“You did, Sim!” exclaimed Lockyer, glancing
into the steel-walled space beyond the chamber
in which they were assembled. “I can see the
valve is at ‘off.’ My boy, I don’t know how to
thank you. If it hadn’t been for your presence
of mind more gas would have escaped and the
boat been blown up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, turning to the others, who looked rather
puzzled, the inventor rapidly explained.</p>

<p>“The gas is kept in a pressure-tank forward.
I filled the tank recently to test out the engines,
but a pipe did not fit, and it was disconnected.
When the pipes were unjointed an open
end was, of course, left in that chamber. It was
thus a simple matter, by turning on the valve,
to flood the chamber with gas.”</p>

<p>“But how did it ignite?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Evidently, that plumber’s torch overturned
near the door, touched it off,” was the rejoinder.
“Great Heavens, if Sim had not done the brave
thing he did, the boat would have been ripped
open as if she were made of tin. Only the fact
that the full quantity of gas was not released
saved the boat.”</p>

<p>Herc had picked up the wrench Sim had
clasped in his unconscious hand, and was examining
it curiously.</p>

<p>“See, sir,” he said, extending it, “it’s marked
T. G.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tom Gradbarr!” exclaimed Mr. Lockyer;
“those are his initials.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Gradbarr?” asked Tom; “what
kind of er craft is he?”</p>

<p>“Why, he is a singularly capable man, who
applied for work here a few days ago. He came
highly recommended, so I put him to work helping
the gang that is cleaning up the hull, for you
see, practically all the work is completed.”</p>

<p>“Would he have had any object in injuring the
boat?” asked Ned, for Sim’s story had naturally
aroused all their suspicions.</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” was the rejoinder;
“but, still, in work of this kind it is hard to tell
who may seek to damage you.”</p>

<p>“But surely he would have attacked the engines
first if he had wished to disable the craft,”
commented Ned, after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p>“Ah! but he could not do that,” said the inventor
quickly; “the engine room is kept locked
always. No one but myself has the key. It is
there that most of our secrets are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the bulkhead door must have been locked,
too,” persisted the boy.</p>

<p>“By Jove, so it was, and only Anderson, the
foreman, had the key. I’ll send for him, and
find out about this. Of course, to get into the
gas compartment, the man must have had the
key.”</p>

<p>“Evidently,” said Ned dryly, “and if I may
offer a word of advice, sir, you will examine this
chap Gradbarr before he gets a chance to leave
the yard&mdash;hullo! what’s that?”</p>

<p>A rivet had fallen from the ladder above and
dropped clattering to the iron-grated floor behind
him. It had been dislodged by Gradbarr’s
foot, but the fellow, who had been listening to
every word uttered below, was too quick to be discovered
by Ned’s upward glance. With the agile
movement of a snake, he slipped from the deck
and down the ladder before his presence was even
suspected.</p>

<p>“Now we will take a look about us,” said Mr.
Lockyer; “feel like moving, Sim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right now, sir,” said the youngster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rising, though rather weakly, to his feet; “say,
but that gas does knock a fellow out when it gets
going.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but on board the boat, when she is in
commission, there will be no danger from it,”
declared the inventor; “automatic valves to regulate
it safely have been provided for.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he fitted a key to a door in an after
bulkhead, similar in all respects to the forward
partition, and led the way into a long, low room
with steel-riveted walls, filled with peculiar-looking
machinery. The boys could make out the
forms of cylinders and crankshafts, but every
other device about the place was strange to them.</p>

<p>The engine-room was unlike any other they
had ever entered. It was spotless, and every bit
of metal fairly gleamed and shone. Queer-looking
levers and handles were everywhere, and at
the farther end of it were several gauges affixed
to another steel bulkhead.</p>

<p>“Behind those gauges are the air-tanks to drive
the engines,” explained the inventor. “Here are
the pumps for compressing it. We can carry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pressure in our tanks of six hundred pounds to
the square inch, which is sufficient to drive the
boat at thirty miles an hour on the surface, and
from eight to fifteen under the water. We have
triple propellers, each driven independently. If
one breaks down it makes little difference.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Herc. Ned looked astonished.
Old Tom only gasped.</p>

<p>“If you can do all that, sir,” he said, “your
craft’s the marvel of the age.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I think she is,” said Lockyer
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“And these pumps here?” asked Ned, indicating
an intricate mass of machinery painted red
and green, and brass-mounted.</p>

<p>“Those are the pumps for regulating the rising
and lowering apparatus. As you, of course,
know, below us and in the extreme bow and stern
are tanks which, when we wish to sink, are filled
with sea-water. If we want to rise and float
on the surface, we set our compressed air at work
and drive out the water. The empty tanks, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
course, supply sufficient buoyancy to float the
boat.”</p>

<p>“And you have no storage batteries or gasolene
engine or electric motors,” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“No. I think that in the Lockyer boat we
have successfully abolished the storage battery,
with its dangerous, metal-corroding fumes, and
the bother of having two sets of engines, the
gasolene for the surface and the electric for
under-water work. We have a dynamo, however,
to furnish current for lighting and other
purposes.”</p>

<p>“How do you get your air-supply when you
are running under water?” asked Ned, his face
beaming with interest.</p>

<p>“When the submarine is afloat you will see
that alongside her periscope she will carry another
pipe. This is of sufficient length to allow
us to run twenty feet under water and still suck
in air. Like the periscope pipe, this air-tube will
telescope up, folding down inside the submarine.
When we are too far below to use this device,
we run on air already compressed in reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
tanks. We can carry enough for five hours of
running without renewing it. In case the pressure
is not high enough, we expand it,&mdash;heating
it by electric radiators.”</p>

<p>“And your fresh air?”</p>

<p>“Still compressed air,” laughed the inventor.
“We drive out the old foul atmosphere through
specially devised valves, the fresh air taking the
place of it.”</p>

<p>“Then the only time you have to utilize the gas
is in starting your engine?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s the only time,” smiled the inventor.
“It enters the cylinders just as gasolene does in
a gasolene motor, and is ignited or exploded by an
electric spark. This gives the impetus to the engines,
and then the gas is cut off and the compressed
air turned on.”</p>

<p>The boys looked dazed. The Lockyer seemed
to be in truth a wonderful vessel. But as yet she
had not entered the water. Even making due allowances
for an inventor’s enthusiasm, it began
to appear to the boys, however, as if they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
on board a craft that would make history in
time to come.</p>

<p>“Now forward,” said Mr. Lockyer, leading
the way through the cabin to the room in which
the explosion of the released gas had occurred,
“we have the torpedo room. Two tubes for
launching two Whitehead torpedoes are provided.
Compressed air is used here, too, you see.
But a charge of gas is exploded in the tube to
fire the torpedoes.”</p>

<p>He indicated a maze of complicated pipes and
valves leading to the rear of the torpedo tubes.
Steel racks lined the sides of the place, which
was in the extreme bow of the craft and, therefore,
shaped like a cone. These supports were
for the torpedoes. Resting places for ten&mdash;five
on each side&mdash;had been provided.</p>

<p>Many other features there were about the craft
which it would only become wearisome to catalogue
here. They will be introduced as occasion
arises and fully explained. As they emerged
from the torpedo room, a heavy-set man in workman’s
clothes, with a foot rule in one hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a wrench in the other, came forward, advancing
through the door in the bulkhead. As it so happened,
Ned was in front and the newcomer
rudely shoved him aside on his way through the
door.</p>

<p>“Get out o’ my way,” he growled. “Don’t you
see I’m in a hurry? Where’s Mr. Lockyer?”</p>

<p>“Here I am, Anderson,” rejoined the inventor,
stepping forward. He had just completed a careful
examination of the room in which the explosion
of gas had occurred. This investigation
confirmed his first decision that little damage had
been done to the craft, thanks to young Sim’s
plucky work.</p>

<p>But as Mr. Lockyer’s gaze lit on Anderson an
angry expression came into his eyes, replacing his
look of satisfaction at the discovery that no damage
had been done.</p>

<p>“Ah, I want to speak to you, Anderson,” he
said, with a sarcastic intonation in his voice; “but
when last I saw you, you were in too much of a
hurry to stop. You and your men were all running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
for dear life, leaving this lad here unconscious
in the gas-filled torpedo room.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t running away,” muttered Anderson.
“I was looking for you, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about that now, Anderson,”
intercepted Mr. Lockyer crisply. “I daresay it
was as you say. Fortunately, no damage was
done. But that is not thanks to you. I am disappointed
in you, Anderson. I made you foreman
here, hoping that you would prove as capable
as my estimation of you. Instead I find that
you gave a newcomer the key to the torpedo room
when you know it was against my strict orders
for any one to enter it till the break in the pipe
had been adjusted.”</p>

<p>“I gave that man the key so as he could take
a look at the pipe,” explained Anderson. “He
said he thought he knew how repairs could be
made on it.”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference, it was against my orders,”
snapped Mr. Lockyer. “You could have
asked me first had you wished to do such a thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Then, too, the door of the gun-cotton shed was
left open. How did that happen?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” grumbled Anderson. “I suppose
you’ll blame that on me, too.”</p>

<p>“If you are yard foreman, you certainly were
responsible for it,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>Some of the other panic-stricken workmen had
returned now and stood clustered on the steel ladder
and about the foot of it, listening curiously.
Apparently their presence made Anderson anxious
to assert his independence for he burst out
in an insolent voice:</p>

<p>“I guess I know more about my business than
any crack-brained inventor. I’m not going to be
talked to that way, either, Mr. Lockyer. Understand?”</p>

<p>“I understand that you can walk to the office
and get your pay, Anderson,” was the prompt retort.
“The sooner you do so, the better it will
suit me. You have been getting more and more
impudent and shiftless every day. This insolence
is the last straw. You are discharged.”</p>

<p>Anderson grew pale for a minute under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
black grime on his face. But he quickly recovered
himself, and his eyes blazed with fury. He
took a step forward and shook his fist under
Lockyer’s nose.</p>

<p>“Fire me if you want to,” he grated out; “but
it will be the sorriest day’s work you ever did.
I know a whole lot about your old submarine tea-kettle
that you wouldn’t want told outside. I’ve
held my tongue hitherto, but I shan’t now. You’ll
see.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Anderson,” said Mr. Lockyer,
turning away. “This has gone far enough.
Men, you can knock off for the rest of the day.
By to-morrow I will have a new foreman for
you. Come, gentlemen, we have about exhausted
the possibilities of the submarine for this
afternoon.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ANDERSON DINES ON MUD.</span></h2>


<p>As the others turned to follow, Sim held back,
but Mr. Lockyer turned to him and beckoned for
him to make one of the party. Leaving Anderson
in the midst of the gang of workmen, they
made their way to the office, where Mr. Lockyer,
unlocking a safe, drew forth a roll of bills. Selecting
one, he presented it to Sim, who gave a
cry of surprise as his eyes fell on its denomination.</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars! Oh, Mr. Lockyer, I
couldn’t think of it! Why, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, see here,” laughed the inventor, “I’m
getting off cheap. If you hadn’t shut off that
gas, I might have lost many times the amount
of that bill.”</p>

<p>The lad was not proof against this line of reasoning,
and finally placed the bill in his pocket.
Soon afterward Anderson presented himself at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the wicket, and was paid off by Mr. Lockyer’s
solitary clerk and bookkeeper. His sullen face
was unusually ferocious as he glared in at the
inventor and his young friends.</p>

<p>“I ain’t through with you yet, Lockyer,” he
roared, apparently in an insane access of fury.
“I’ll fix you. You’ll see. I hope you and your
submarine go to rust and ruin on the floor of
the Sound. I hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do, Anderson,” said the inventor
quietly. “I wish to hear no more from you.”</p>

<p>“But you will. Don’t you fool yourself on
that,” exclaimed the furious man, flinging out
of the office with muttered imprecations on his
lips.</p>

<p>“That feller needs a short cruise in ther brig,”
commented old Tom, as Anderson dashed out of
the place.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have had to get rid of him, for
he was a competent workman,” said Mr. Lockyer.
“But he has been becoming altogether too aggressive
of late. By the way, I wonder where that
chap Gradbarr is. I want to interview him, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and find out how he happened to turn on that
gas. It’s a horrible suspicion to have; but it
looks to me almost like a deliberate attempt to
wreck the craft.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks to me, too, sir,” agreed
Ned.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Mr. Lockyer suddenly, “do
you boys know anything about thread-cutting?
I’d like to get that pipe connection fitted up to-night.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can help you,” said Ned, and, accordingly,
they retraced their steps to the submarine
shed. The workmen had all left by this
time, but they found the tools they needed, and
soon had the measurements of the connection, and
the required pitch of the screw to be cut on the
new pipe. This done, they started for the machine
shop to finish up the work. Sim, however,
who was still white and shaky after his experience,
was ordered home by Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>“You’ve done enough for one day, Sim,” he
said. “Be off home now, and report bright and
early to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As Sim made off, the inventor looked after
him.</p>

<p>“There’s a lad that has the makings of a fine
man in him,” he said. “He applied here for work
some weeks ago, and, being short of a helper, I
gave him a job. He knew something about metal
working, as his father was formerly blacksmith
here. The man died some time ago, and since
then I guess Sim and his mother have had a hard
time to get along. That hundred dollars will
look very large to them.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did a plucky thing,” agreed Ned.
“It takes courage of the right sort to put through
what he did.”</p>

<p>“Bother it all,” exclaimed the inventor, after a
few minutes’ work on the pipe. “I’ve just recalled
that we have no red lead to make the joint
tight with. We used up our last yesterday. I
wonder if one of you would mind going up to
the village for some.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Ned. “I’m pining for exercise.
Herc, here, and myself will be up there and
back in no time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanking them, Mr. Lockyer gave them directions
where to go, and some money. The Dreadnought
Boys were soon off on their errand. The
shop found, it did not take long to make their
purchases and, with the parcel under Ned’s arm,
they started back.</p>

<p>“There’s a short cut to the water, through
that field there,” said Ned, as they came to a
turning. “Let’s take it and save time.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, they presently emerged in a
low-lying meadow, thickly grown with clumps of
alders and other swamp shrubs. A path threaded
among them, however, which apparently led almost
direct to the boat yard.</p>

<p>“We’d have saved time if we’d known about
this before,” observed Ned, and was about to add
something more when he stopped short. From
what was apparently only a short distance ahead,
there had come a cry of pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, please don’t, Mr. Anderson.”</p>

<p>“You young blackguard, I’ll break your arm
for you if you don’t tell me everything,” growled
out a voice they recognized as that of the recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
discharged foreman. “It was you that
told on me, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Another cry of pain followed.</p>

<p>“It’s Anderson. He’s ill-treating that young
Sim!” cried Ned, his face flushing angrily. The
Dreadnought Boy hated to hear of anything weak
and small being badly used.</p>

<p>“Come on, Herc, we’ll take a hand in this,” he
said.</p>

<p>They advanced rapidly, yet almost noiselessly,
and in a second a turn of the path brought them
upon the two whose voices they had heard. Anderson
had hold of Sim’s arm and was twisting
it tightly while he pounded on the back of it with
one burly fist to make the agony more excruciating.</p>

<p>“Here you, let go of that boy!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Anderson looked up furiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you interfering again, is it? Now
you take my advice and keep out of this. I don’t
know who you are and I don’t want to, but just
keep on your way, or you’ll get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” rejoined Ned easily. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
you don’t stop ill-treating that boy, it’s <em>you</em> that
will get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” snarled Anderson. “Well, Mister
Busy-body, I’ll just do as I please.”</p>

<p>So saying, he gave Sim’s arm, which he had
not released, an additional twist, causing the
frail lad to cry out again. But before the cry had
completely left the boy’s lips, Ned’s hand had
closed upon Anderson’s wrist, and that worthy,
with a snort of pain, suddenly found himself
staggering backward under the force of the quick
twist the boy had given him.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you!” he cried, recovering himself
and bellowing with rage. “Mind yourself!”</p>

<p>But it was Anderson who should have minded.
As he spoke, he made a mad rush at Ned, who,
not wishing to hurt the man, simply sidestepped
as the other came on. But he left one foot extended,
and as Anderson came in contact with it
he tripped.</p>

<p>Floundering wildly, he sought to retain his balance.
But the effort was in vain.</p>

<p>Splash!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Over he went, spread-eagle fashion, face down
into a pool of stagnant swamp water.</p>

<p>“Haw! Haw! Haw!” laughed Herc. “Say,
mister, you’re so fond of water that you just have
to wallow in it like a hog, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Anderson scrambled to his feet a sorry sight.
Mud daubed his face and the front of his clothing.
Mud was in his hair, his eyes, his nose, and
his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you,” he cried, making another dash
at Ned, but this time the Dreadnought Boy simply
caught the enraged fellow’s wrists and held
them to his sides as easily as if he had been restraining
a fractious child.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, Anderson,” he shot out,
“you’ve had trouble enough for one day. Don’t
look for more. Now get!”</p>

<p>Cowed by Ned’s determined manner, but more
especially by the easy fashion in which the boy
had quelled him, holding him helpless as an infant,
Anderson “got.” But as he strode off
through the bushes there was a dark look on his
face, a look that boded no good to the Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Boys, who, however, hardly gave the matter
a further thought. Seeing Sim safe on his
way home, they turned once more to their path
and arrived at the boat yard in due time.</p>

<p>“Took you fellows longer than you expected,
didn’t it?” asked Mr. Lockyer, as they appeared.</p>

<p>“We attended to a little business on the way,”
replied Ned quietly; “and now if you are ready,
Mr. Lockyer, we’ll fit that pipe.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Anderson, instead of going
home, had hied himself to the village hotel, which
boasted of a drinking bar. In this place he
sought solace for his woes as many another foolish
or weak man has done before him. In the
midst of his angry musings, a man stepped in
who, apparently, recognized Anderson, for he
stopped short and gave a low whistle.</p>

<p>“Anderson! Wonder what he is doing here
at this time of day.”</p>

<p>Stepping forward, he came up behind the disgruntled
foreman with an appearance of great
cordiality.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, old man,” he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
“Work through at the yard? What are you
doing here at this hour?”</p>

<p>“Gradbarr!” exclaimed Anderson, surprised in
his turn, as he faced the other. “Why ain’t you
down at the yard?”</p>

<p>“Oh, after that blow-up I decided to quit. Too
risky a job for a family man like me.”</p>

<p>“Where is your family?” inquired Anderson.
“Never knew you had one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in California,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Hum, you keep far enough away from them,”
commented Anderson; “and, by the way, I’ve got
a bone to pick with you. You got me discharged
over your borrowing of that key.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Gradbarr, with genuine
surprise. “Fired? How’s that? Although,
now I come to notice it, you do look a bit mussed
up. Bin in a fight?”</p>

<p>“Why no,” was the sullen rejoinder. “What
made you think that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Gradbarr, “men don’t generally
roll in the mud if they can help it, and by
the looks of you that’s what you’ve bin a-doin’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
But tell me about how you come to be fired. If
it’s my fault, I’ll make it right with you.”</p>

<p>Anderson soon related his own version of how
he came to be discharged. He was in an angry,
reckless mood, and did not care how loud he
talked, so that he had for a listener Jeb Sproggs,
the landlord of the hotel. Jeb listened with open
mouth and ears to Anderson’s description of the
“young whelps,” as he termed them, who had
accompanied Mr. Lockyer, meaning, of course,
Ned and Herc. “And there was an old geezer,
too,” he went on; “looked like some sort of a retired
fisherman.”</p>

<p>“Why them fellows is registered here,” put in
the landlord, as Anderson concluded. “Yep,” he
continued, “their names is Strong, Taylor, and
the old feller’s called Marlin.”</p>

<p>“Then they weren’t mere butt-in visitors to the
yard as I had them figgered out to be,” cried
Anderson.</p>

<p>“Why no,” said Sproggs, discarding a badly
mangled toothpick. “As I understand it, them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lads is here on special duty connected with that
diving boat. They’re in the Navy.”</p>

<p>“The Navy!” exclaimed Gradbarr. “Then I
may be too late.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Anderson eagerly. “Do
you know them?”</p>

<p>“No,” rejoined Gradbarr, “I don’t know them
and I don’t much care to, from what you’ve told
me about them. But I’ve got to be going on.
Say,” he continued, in a whisper, bending over
till his mouth was quite close to Anderson’s ear,
“do you want to be put in the way of revenging
yourself on Lockyer and that whole bunch?”</p>

<p>“Do I?” Anderson’s eyes lit up with a vicious
flare. He involuntarily clenched his fists.</p>

<p>“Well, walk up the street with me a way and
I’ll tell you how to get even.”</p>

<p>For a moment Anderson wavered. After all,
this man was a stranger to him. It might be a
trap to draw him out and discover if he cherished
any harm to the submarine. But then his
evil, vindictive nature asserted itself. He ached
and palpitated with his every sense to avenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
himself on the man who had humiliated him
before the whole crew of workmen, and particularly
was he desirous of making Ned Strong and
his companion smart for the indignities they had
thrust upon him.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“A tool ready to my hand,” was the thought
that flashed across Gradbarr’s mind as, arm in
arm, the two worthies strolled from the hotel and
slowly walked up the village street.</p>

<p>That evening, as the Dreadnought Boys and
their weather-beaten comrade were returning to
the hotel, they encountered Zeb Anderson. They
would have avoided him if they could, but as he
planted himself in their path there was no way of
escaping a meeting. But that they were not anxious
to court such an encounter, our party was
showing by hurrying on, when Anderson caught
Ned by the arm.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you think you and me had a brush and
you win,” he said in a voice harsh with hate.
“Well, just you wait. Our score ain’t evened up
yet. You’re going ter sea on that old submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I hear. Well,” he said, raising his voice, “I
know more about her than you do. You’ll all go
to the bottom every last man of you and leave
your bones rotting there. That’s what I hope
and that’s what will be.”</p>

<p>With this amiable prophecy, Anderson strode
off down the street, casting back ever and anon
a glance of hatred at the naval party.</p>

<p>“Wall,” exclaimed Tom Marlin, who had been
made acquainted by the boys with what had occurred
in the alder swamp, “if words could drown
we’d be dead by this time, all right.”</p>

<p>“Somehow, though, I think that that man Anderson
is a good fellow to watch out for,” replied
Ned. “He has the look in his eye of a man who
might become insane from brooding upon his
fancied wrongs.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, there is the Lieutenant and Midshipman
Stark, and there’s good old Stanley, too,”
cried Herc suddenly, pointing to a group in front
of the hotel. Hastening their steps, our party
was soon respectfully saluting Lieutenant Parry
and his aide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning work was resumed at the
yard, with Andy Bowler, a capable workman, in
Anderson’s place as superintendent. Sim was
made his assistant, and work was rapidly rushed
ahead. Sim proved himself, in spite of his tender
years, to be a genius with machinery, and he
and the Dreadnought Boys became firm friends.
All this time the naval party was acquainting itself
thoroughly with the principles of the Lockyer
engine so that when the time came they could take
sole charge of the craft and test her in every way.</p>

<p>All this time nothing further had been heard
of Gradbarr, who, as we have seen, had failed
in his first attempt to damage the submarine. He
did not even appear to collect his money. Mr.
Lockyer, with an idea of having him arrested,
notified the police, but they could find no trace of
him. Anderson was seen about the village and
appeared to have plenty of money, although the
source of his income was more or less of a mystery.
But things were so busy at the yard that
the boys or any one connected with the plant
had little time to waste on speculations concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the rascally pair. Work in the craft was
rushed day and night. Rapidly it narrowed down
to mere details.</p>

<p>One bright afternoon Mr. Lockyer seized up
a megaphone and by its agency announced
throughout the yard that the work was practically
finished. What a cheer went up as the
men gathered about him! Another shout arose
when it was given out that each man that evening
would find a ten-dollar bill awaiting him at
the office.</p>

<p>“When is the launching set for, sir?” inquired
Ned of Mr. Lockyer that evening.</p>

<p>“There will be no formal launching, with invited
guests, a brass band, and all that; but we’ll
run her off the ways to-morrow, if it’s a good
day,” was the reply. “I can hardly believe that
the crucial test is so near. I wonder, will she
make good?”</p>

<p>“You’ll win out, sir, never fear,” Ned assured
the inventor, who was beginning to show the effect
of his long strain.</p>

<p>Herc echoed his comrade’s assurances, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they came from hearts that meant every word of
them, too. Both lads had come to have a strong
liking and respect for the young inventor. The
feeling was mutual. Channing Lockyer had
grown to feel that he had near him at least three
staunch, loyal hearts, upon whom he could depend
in an emergency.</p>

<p>How soon that emergency was to come not one
of them guessed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LIKE THIEVES IN THE NIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mr. Lockyer that
evening, “I’ve forgotten to provide a flag for the
launching.”</p>

<p>The inventor had dined with the officers at the
hotel, his own home being made with his sister
some little distance outside the village. Now they
were seated on the porch.</p>

<p>“That is a serious omission truly,” agreed
Lieutenant Parry, “but surely you can get one
in the village here.”</p>

<p>The telephone was put into requisition, but it
was found, to their disappointment, that it would
be impossible to obtain any kind of a flag nearer
than Picksville, a town which boasted some quite
large stores.</p>

<p>“I’d drive over there to-night rather than not
have a flag on the Lockyer to-morrow,” said the
inventor, “but it is absolutely necessary that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
make those final computations on the gas pressure
areas.”</p>

<p>“Why not let some of our boys go,” suggested
the naval officer. “Strong and Taylor would be
delighted at the idea of such an excursion. They
can get a rig here at the livery attached to the
hotel.”</p>

<p>“The very thing,” exclaimed the inventor, and
hastened off to find the lads. He discovered them
with Boatswain’s Mate Stanley and old Tom.
The four were busily discussing old times in
Costaveza when Mr. Lockyer came upon them.
Stanley, it will be recalled, had played a prominent
part in the adventures of the “Dreadnought
Boys Aboard a Destroyer.” Mr. Lockyer soon
explained his errand, and, of course, our lads
jumped at the chance of a long drive on a fine,
moonlight night.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parry having put the official sanction
upon the trip, the lads set out shortly afterward.</p>

<p>“Say, Ned,” remarked Herc, as they drove
along the moon-flooded roads, “it seems to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
we’re having pretty easy times for two able-bodied
Boatswain’s Mates.”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get to work on board the Lockyer
in real earnest,” rejoined Ned. “I fancy
you’ll find a difference then. Of course, on special
duty like this discipline is always relaxed a
good deal, but when we get to sea again, even in
a submarine, the old lines will be drawn.”</p>

<p>“Oh Chowder!” grumbled Herc. “I suppose
that means more of those everlasting sea-going
chores.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” laughed Ned; “but every day we
do our full duty, Herc, we’re getting closer to
the goal we set ourselves back in Lamb’s Corners&mdash;to
make the best sailors we could of ourselves,
and devote our best efforts for our country’s
good. A sailor can do that, too, just as well as
some pork-fed politician who wallows in a lot of
oratory about saving the nation.”</p>

<p>“I wish there were a little less of deck-cleaning
and brass work, though,” complained Herc.</p>

<p>“Wait till we take our next step up,” was Ned’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
assurance. “We’ll be able to live almost as easy
as commissioned officers then.”</p>

<p>“Hope so,” muttered Herc; “things can’t come
too easy for me.”</p>

<p>“And yet, you old Red Head,” rejoined Ned
affectionately, “when there’s anything to be done,
you’re right there on the spot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s when there’s some excitement
in it,” was Herc’s reply.</p>

<p>What with taking a wrong turn and some delay
in getting just the sized flag they required,
it was quite late when the lads started back for
Grayport. In fact, as they neared the little seaside
town, they could hear the clock in the old
Dutch church strike midnight. It was the only
sound to disturb the moonlit stillness. The town,
seemingly, was wrapped in slumber. At any rate,
not a light was to be seen.</p>

<p>“We’re night owls, all right,” laughed Herc.</p>

<p>Their road led around the seaward end of the
village, skirting the high fence of the Lockyer
boatyard. As they drew near Ned pulled up the
horse with an abrupt jerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Herc, in a whisper,
however, as, while Ned had checked the horse
with one hand, his other had gone up in a signal
for silence.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m certain I saw some one scale that
fence and drop over into the yard just as we were
coming round that corner.”</p>

<p>“Well, if there was, Mr. Lockyer has a watchman
on duty,” rejoined Herc.</p>

<p>“I know, but, Herc, think of what that yard
contains,&mdash;all Channing Lockyer’s hopes and aspirations.
If that boat were to be injured I think
it would kill him, coming as it would on the eve
of her launching.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Herc; “maybe we’d better
leave the horse here and do a little scouting.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Presently the horse was tied and they were
slipping forward almost noiselessly. They soon
reached the fence at the spot where Ned thought
he had seen some one climb over, and found that
several nails had been driven in it at that point,
making an ascent comparatively easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look, what’s that at the top where the spikes
are?” asked Herc suddenly, pointing to the tip-top
of the fence on the spikes, surmounting which
some dark object laid.</p>

<p>“It’s a sack or something placed there so that
the spikes will not hurt anybody climbing over,”
was the rejoinder. “That proves I was right.
Somebody did go over and their object was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The submarine!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and that watchman isn’t on the
job, or he’d have been at them by this time. Herc,
it’s up to us to do something. I’ve got half a
suspicion who the rascal is, and if we don’t get
him, he may do damage that it will take months
to repair. You know that Mr. Lockyer’s funds
won’t hold out that long.”</p>

<p>“Then over we go,” declared Herc, starting to
climb. With sailor-like activity, he was soon on
the top of the fence, and found that a sack stuffed
full of rags had been carefully laid on the top
of the spikes. After him came Ned. In a jiffy
they stood inside the yard, uncertain for an instant
just what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Strong in his conviction that it was the submarine
that the midnight marauders were bent
on attacking, Ned led the way across the yard,
taking advantage of every shadow and the cover
afforded by the outbuildings. As they neared the
big shed in which the completed craft lay resting
ready on her supports for the launching, they
heard a sudden sharp, spluttering sound. Ned
gripped Herc’s arm and held him back. Fortunately,
they were behind the corner of the office
building and could see without being seen, unless
they exposed themselves too much.</p>

<p>Following the sputtering sound, a match
blazed up and illumined the faces of two figures
bent over a lantern. They were going to light it
before they entered the building.</p>

<p>“Two of them!” gasped Herc.</p>

<p>“Yes, and do you recognize them?” breathed
back Ned.</p>

<p>“Thunder and turtles! One of them is that fellow
Anderson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the other is Gradbarr. I didn’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he was in the village. He must have been hiding
some place all this time.”</p>

<p>“And Anderson must still have that key,” whispered
Herc, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Oh, don’t I wish we could get the
police. But I daren’t leave here till we see what
they are up to.”</p>

<p>The next instant the lantern blazed up, and cautiously
turning the flame low, the two slipped
into the dark shadows of the construction shed.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” asked Herc.</p>

<p>“Going after them,” announced Ned grimly,
and without an instant’s hesitation.</p>

<p>It was necessary to use the utmost stealth in
nearing the shed. For all that the Dreadnought
Boys knew, the two rascals might be hiding inside
ready to shoot them down as soon as they
appeared. But, after waiting a while, they were
rewarded by hearing the ring of the intruders’
feet as they traversed the steel-plated deck.</p>

<p>“They’ve climbed the ladder, then,” breathed
Ned tremulously. The next instant a clanging
sound announced that they had opened the manhole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in the conning tower. As the sound was
not repeated, the boys judged that they must
have left it open. This made their task all the
easier.</p>

<p>With their nerves at the keenest tension, the
lads crept forward. Presently the dark shadows
of the shed swallowed them. Creeping along
like two prowling cats, they reached the midship
section against which the ladder was propped.</p>

<p>Without another word Ned set his foot on the
lowest round and mounted rapidly upward. Following
him came Herc, his every sense a-tingle
for what might lie ahead of them.</p>

<p>Having reached the deck, double caution became
necessary, for fear that the ring of their
feet on the metal might attract the attention of
the marauders working inside the big cigar-shaped
diving boat. Creeping on hands and
knees, the better to dull all sound, they neared the
conning tower. Still without a sound, Ned raised
himself, and peering over, saw that the chamber
below&mdash;which was now fitted with leather-backed
divans and seats and partitioned staterooms, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
empty. The mischief-makers must then be in the
fore part of the little vessel, in the torpedo room,
already the scene of one of Gradbarr’s dastardly
attempts.</p>

<p>Beckoning to Herc, Ned swung himself down
into the conning tower and swiftly dropped down,
round by round, on the steel ladder. And now he
had a view of the night’s work the two dastards
had contrived. The light of their lantern shone
brightly out from the fore-chamber and cast a
soft glow out in the cabin.</p>

<p>Peering through the bulkhead door, which Anderson’s
key had unlocked, the boys could see the
precious pair bending over one of the intake pipes.
Suddenly the rasping note of a file sounded out in
the silence.</p>

<p>“Your boat will sink and you with it, Lockyer,
when I get through to-night’s work,” the lads
could hear Anderson grate out, as his tool began
to bite into the metal. It was at this moment that
Ned recollected, with a sinking of the heart, that
neither Herc nor himself was armed. The men
attempting the ruin of Lockyer’s boat were undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
well supplied with firearms in case of
being surprised in their desperate game. How
then were our lads to circumvent the rascals and
check their ruinous work?</p>

<p>As Ned cudgelled his brains desperately&mdash;for
every minute counted while that file was at work&mdash;the
hulking form of Gradbarr swung across
the floor of the lamp-lit chamber, and peered out
into the darkness of the cabin.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard something out here,” he
growled, in reply to Anderson’s muttered question.</p>

<p>Coming forward still farther, he rested his
hand on the foot of the steel ladder and peered
upward. A ray of the lamp fell full on his heavy,
brutal features. That ray flashed for an instant
on something gleaming that he carried in one
hand&mdash;a pistol.</p>

<p>Ned noted all this in one quick flash, and then,
with one of those impulses to quick action that
come to us all sometimes, he let go his hold on
the ladder and dropped with all his weight upon
the ruffian. The Dreadnought Boy’s legs encircled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Gradbarr’s neck, and before the man, taken
entirely by surprise, could utter a sound, Ned’s
weight had borne him down to the steel-grated
floor of the cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THERE’S MANY A SLIP.</span></h2>


<p>With a roar like that which might have been
expected to proceed from an infuriated bull,
rather than from the throat of a human being,
the husky henchman of the Atlas Submarine interests
struck out blindly. But his blows only
encountered the steel floor, and barked the skin
off his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Better save your breath and your blows, my
man,” warned Ned, who was seated comfortably
astride the fellow’s neck.</p>

<p>While this had been going on, Herc, deprived
of movement for a second from sheer astonishment,
had dropped lightly beside them. Seeing
at a glance that Ned needed no help, he turned
his attention to Anderson, who, hearing the commotion
outside, had dropped his work and come
running toward the door. The fellow’s inherent
cowardice showed in his pallid cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“W-w-what is it?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Discovery, you precious hound!” explained
Herc. Before Anderson could use the pistol he
carried, the Dreadnought Boy’s fist had struck
it upward out of his hand. The weapon fell ringing
on the metal flooring.</p>

<p>The next instant Herc had possession of it.</p>

<p>“Now get hold of this fellow’s gun. I can’t
hold him much longer,” gasped Ned, from his
position on the recumbent Gradbarr’s neck.
While Ned held the fellow’s wrist pinned tightly
to the floor, Herc took possession of the pistol
which Gradbarr still gripped.</p>

<p>“Blazes take you,” fumed the fellow. “I’ll
make you sorry for this some day. I’ll fix you.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to defer it till after you get
out of the penitentiary,” shot out Ned. “We’ve
caught you two in as precious a bit of knavery
as was ever heard of.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he let go of Gradbarr, and, springing
nimbly aside out of the way of a possible
sudden attack, allowed the man to rise. For one
instant bovine rage flared on the fellow’s sullen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
features. But the next moment he seemed to
realize that he was overmastered.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do with us?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>Anderson stood trembling by. Suddenly he
broke into hysterical pleadings.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake don’t disgrace me,” he
begged. “Think of what it’ll mean to me to go
to prison.”</p>

<p>“Think of what it would have meant to Mr.
Lockyer if you had succeeded in undoing the
work of a lifetime,” rejoined Ned. “No, Anderson,
I’m sorry for you, but you’ve got to take
your medicine. I advise you to take it like a man.
In any event, it is not for us to decide this matter.
That must be left to Mr. Lockyer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out that preachy-preachy, and tell us
what you are going to do with us,” growled Gradbarr
defiantly.</p>

<p>Now this was a bit of a problem. They could
not very well manage the risky business of
marching their prisoners out of the yard in the
darkness. Too many opportunities for escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
presented themselves. Suddenly the solution
flashed upon Ned. There was a heavy bar on the
outside, or cabin side, of the bulkhead door. He
would drive them into the torpedo room and deprive
them of their tools. Then, with the door
locked, they could be safely left in there till he
summoned aid.</p>

<p>“March into that torpedo room,” he ordered,
emphasizing his command by leveling his revolver.</p>

<p>“Confound you, I’ll see you hanged first,”
snarled Gradbarr, making as if he was about to
dare all and risk a dash for freedom. But something
in the glint of Ned’s eyes at that instant
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to get into that room, Gradbarr?”
inquired the Dreadnought Boy, quietly
and without a quaver in his voice, though his
heart was beating wildly. What if the fellow
wouldn’t go? Ned would not&mdash;could not&mdash;shoot
him down in cold blood. Fortunately, however,
Gradbarr gave sullen acquiescence to the sharp
order by turning and reëntering the room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
which the lamp still stood on the floor. Anderson,
whining and pleading by turns, followed him.</p>

<p>“Pick up their tools, Herc, while I keep them
covered,” ordered Ned.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the red-headed lad had the
tools gathered up, while Ned kept two unwavering
revolvers pointed at his prisoners.</p>

<p>“All ready, Ned,” said Herc, at length.</p>

<p>“Then get that lantern and follow me. Don’t
move,” ordered Ned, slowly backing out and not
allowing his weapons to deviate an inch.</p>

<p>“You’re going to leave us here in the dark?”
inquired Gradbarr.</p>

<p>“It’s the only safe thing to do,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>As the two lads reached the door, Ned made a
quick step backward and seized the hand rail on
the outside of the room. He was only just in
time, for the instant that he relaxed his vigilance
Gradbarr made a desperate spring for him.
But his leap was met, not by the lad’s form,
but by a ponderous mass of metal as the door
swung to. The next moment the heavy clang of
the bar on the cabin side falling into place apprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
both rascals, even had they required such
notification, that they were prisoners.</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed Ned, “I’m mighty glad
that is over. One second more with that door
and we’d have had a tussle on our hands. I don’t
admire Mr. Gradbarr, but he is certainly a
fighter. He’s all beef and brawn, mixed with
steel alloy.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do now?” asked Herc, as they
could hear from the other side of the door Gradbarr’s
furious voice railing at them.</p>

<p>“Make tracks for the new foreman’s house. He
lives close to here, and then we must summon Mr.
Lockyer and Lieutenant Parry,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“You don’t think they’ll do any harm in that
torpedo room just out of rage at being captured?”</p>

<p>“Well, they can’t do much harm. We’ve got
their tools,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>At the gate of the yard, they almost stumbled
over a moving form asleep on a bench.</p>

<p>“It’s the watchman,” exclaimed Ned disgustedly.
“He smells of liquor, too. He’s a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
guardian for such a valuable bit of property as
that submarine.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wake him?” asked Herc.</p>

<p>“No. What good would it do? Come on,
we’ve no time to waste. Say, though, this fine
specimen of a watchman has left his keys lying
by his side. We’ll just use them and save ourselves
the trouble of climbing over the fence.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” declared Ned, as they put it into
execution, and hastened out of the yard.</p>

<p>Andy Bowler was tremendously excited when
he had been aroused and made to understand
what had taken place. He hastily dressed, and,
as the boys had brought the rig with them from
the place at which they had left it tied, they were
hardly any time in reaching the hotel. Here
Lieutenant Parry was awakened and the news
communicated to him. Mr. Lockyer was summoned
by telephone and soon joined them.</p>

<p>“How can I ever thank you,” he exclaimed
warmly, as he met the party. “Boys, if that boat
had been damaged to-night, it would have been
a death blow to all my hopes. I don’t mind being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
frank enough to tell you that I would not have
had enough capital left to indulge in any very
extensive repairs.”</p>

<p>All haste was made in returning to the yard,
and the first thing that was done was to awaken
the watchman. What he heard about himself
immediately thereafter must have made his ears
burn for the remainder of his lifetime. The
wretched man, half fuddled with liquor, lost no
time in staggering off, and the next day left the
village.</p>

<p>This done, the party proceeded to the submarine
shed, having first provided themselves
with lanterns at the storeroom. A deadly silence
hung over the place as they entered instead of
the half-smothered yells and shouts the lads had
expected to hear.</p>

<p>“I guess they realize they’re in a thick box,”
said Lieutenant Parry, “and so are saving their
breath for another occasion. Now then, let’s get
below.”</p>

<p>So saying, he swung himself down inside the
conning tower, followed by the others. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
steel door in the bulkhead they paused. But there
was not a sound from within.</p>

<p>“Gradbarr and Anderson,” shouted Mr. Lockyer,
pounding on the door, “I wish to tell you in
case you feel like making any resistance that we
are all armed and shall not hesitate to use our
weapons.”</p>

<p>There was no reply. In the intense stillness
one could hear the creaking, crackling sounds that
always are present in a metal boat, as the material
of which she is constructed contracts after
a warm day.</p>

<p>“Better open up,” said Lieutenant Parry. “Mr.
Lockyer, you stand at the foot of the ladder and
be ready to shoot in case of trouble. We’ll open
the door and try to collar the fellows without
hurting them if they rush out.”</p>

<p>Clang!</p>

<p>The metal bar dropped as Ned pulled it out
of its hasp. But there was still no sound from
within.</p>

<p>The next moment the inventor’s party had
swung the portal wide open. But the expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
rush did not come, nor was there a sound to show
that the dark torpedo-room was occupied.</p>

<p>“Bring a light here,” ordered Lieutenant
Parry. “I believe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But there was no need for him to finish his sentence.
Ned’s upraised lantern showed every nook
and corner of the place.</p>

<p>It was empty of life.</p>

<p>It was almost immediately apparent how the
two prisoners had effected their escape. Forward,
where one of the after-base plates of the
torpedo tubes had not been bolted in place, there
was an easy means of exit which the lads, to
their chagrin, had not noticed before. Evidently,
all that Gradbarr and Anderson had had to do
to gain their liberty was to enter the torpedo tube
and crawl through.</p>

<p>“Good gracious,” cried Ned, vexed beyond
measure; “we must have been blind or foolish
or both not to have noticed that opening.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant, however, placed his hand comfortingly
upon the disgusted lad’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my lad,” he said; “you are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the first boy&mdash;or man, for that matter&mdash;who has
forgotten that there are more ways than one out
of a difficulty. Is it any use pursuing them, I wonder?”
he went on, turning to Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>“If you ask my advice I should reply in the
negative,” was the answer. “No doubt they are
both far away by this time.”</p>

<p>“And good riddance, too,” muttered Herc to
himself, an opinion which was shared by the
others.</p>

<p>“At any rate, we’ll have a good guard here
for the remainder of the night,” said the foreman,
and, in accordance with his resolution that
no more attempts would be made on the boat
with his knowledge, the faithful fellow passed
the rest of the night on board. As for the others,
with plenty to ponder over, they returned to the
hotel, where they slept soundly till the dawn of
the day which was to witness the launching of
“Lockyer’s Dream.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“I NAME YOU ‘LOCKYER.’”</span></h2>


<p>Somehow one is always prone to associate the
idea of a launching of a vessel of any kind with
crowds, gaiety, and blaring brass bands. Except
for the fact, however, that a brand-new flag
floated above the boatyard on the day that the
long-expected event was to take place, there was
no sign that anything unusual was going on.</p>

<p>All hands reported at the yard early, the workmen
in their best clothes, the naval contingent in
uniforms. A few finishing touches remained to
be put upon the boat, and the slight damage done
by Anderson’s file to be adjusted. A little more
than an hour sufficed for this, however, and then
all was ready.</p>

<p>“At last,” breathed Mr. Lockyer, as the foreman,
with a formal touch of his cap, said:</p>

<p>“We’re ready when you are, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parry tried to look unconcerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
but under his naval mask of indifference it could
be seen that he was excited. As for the boys,
their faces shone with anticipation. Old Tom
Marlin went about with a broad grin on his face,
clapping everybody on the shoulder and singing
snatches of musty sea chanties.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, word had spread
that there was something unusual going on at
the yard. By the time all was in readiness quite
a crowd had gathered. Several persons tried to
get in at the gate, but they were ruthlessly informed
that no one would be admitted. As the
next best thing, they made for points of vantage
along the beach outside the fence; for, by some
species of wireless telegraphy, there was now a
well-defined rumor that “‘Lockyer’s Dream’ was
to take to the water that morning.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what we’re waiting for?” mused
Ned, as ten o’clock struck and still Mr. Lockyer
paced nervously up and down, without giving the
signal to go aboard. Some workmen, hammers
in hand, stood about ready to knock out the remaining
props as soon as the word should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
given, and send the grim diving torpedo boat
sliding down the ways into the sea.</p>

<p>“Tide’ll turn before long, sir,” ventured the
foreman, stepping up to Mr. Lockyer. The inventor
gave a sigh and seemed to start out of a
reverie.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” he said. “I guess you may
as well give the order to go ahead.”</p>

<p>But as he spoke, from outside the fence there
came a sudden interruption to the hush of suspense
that had settled over the occupants of the
boatyard and the crowd outside.</p>

<p>The sharp “honk-honk” of an auto could be
heard as it was urged through the curious crowd
clustered outside the gates. A sudden change
came over the inventor as he heard it. His gloom
seemed to vanish like magic, and he made for
the gate in great bounds. Reaching it, he flung
it open himself, and a touring car, driven by a
liveried chauffeur and containing two passengers,
was driven into the yard. To the astonishment
of the boys, one of the occupants of the car was a
singularly beautiful young woman, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a stout, gray-whiskered man in a frock coat,
white waistcoat and many other outward and
accepted trappings of wealth.</p>

<p>The inventor&mdash;an odd contrast to the daintily
gowned girl and the smartly tailored old man, in
his greasy overalls which he had donned for the
launching&mdash;was at the side of the car in an instant,
aiding the young woman to alight. This
done, he extended a hand to the old man, but the
latter spurned it.</p>

<p>“I can help myself, Lockyer,” he snapped out;
“not too old for that yet. So to-day is the day
that you are going to launch that insane myth
of yours&mdash;the cruising submarine?”</p>

<p>“It is, Mr. Pangloss,” rejoined the inventor,
“and I feel very much flattered that you have
decided to be present on the occasion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have to thank me for that,” flashed
the young woman with a radiant smile. “I told
you we would not fail you, and you see we
haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” breathed the inventor, in a low
tone. “I felt sure you would be here if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
possible. <em>You</em>, at least, have always believed in
me.”</p>

<p>“And so will dad when the Lockyer is afloat,”
laughed the young woman gaily. “James,” she
went on, turning to the chauffeur, “get that
basket out of the tonneau. You see, Mr. Lockyer,”
she smiled, “I have not forgotten that I
am to christen the boat, and we have brought the
baptismal font with us.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” remarked Lieutenant Parry, turning
to Midshipman Stark, “there’s Lockyer’s romance.
It’s easy to see that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he wins out,” was the rejoinder.
“He’s a good fellow and she is one of the most
beautiful girls I have ever seen. But her father&mdash;for
I guess the old man is her father&mdash;doesn’t
seem to approve.”</p>

<p>Indeed the old man had been stamping about
the yard, poking at castings and odd bits of machinery
with his cane, and asking sharp questions
of the different workmen. Presently Mr. Lockyer
introduced his guests as Miss Vivian Pangloss
and her father, Peregrine Pangloss. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
girl smiled gracefully through the introductions,
but her father, on the other hand, seemed anxious
to assert his entire disbelief in the submarine and
all who had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>“It’s nonsense, gentlemen, nonsense!” he asserted
emphatically. “Man’s place in nature is on
the earth or on the surface of the waters. He has
no business either to fly in the air or to dive under
the ocean.”</p>

<p>“In that event you would naturally limit human
progress,” put in Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>“And what of it, sir? What of it?” puffed old
Mr. Pangloss. “I have lived for sixty years, sir,
and all that time have managed to get along without
any such nonsensical things, and so did my
ancestors before me. It’s obvious, then, that
there is no need of them. Mankind is better off
without them.”</p>

<p>“But in case of war, sir,” put in Midshipman
Stark. “If the Lockyer is as capable a submarine
as we hope she will prove to be, the nation possessing
her will be years ahead of any other, at
least, so far as naval warfare is concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bah, sir! War ought to be abolished,”
snapped the old man. “I’d like to shoot or hang
everybody who talks about war, or is connected
with it in any way.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we take a look over the boat before
she is launched,” suggested the inventor, tactfully
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be the very thing,” cried Miss
Pangloss excitedly. “I am sure it is a wonderful
boat and will be a great success.”</p>

<p>“It will&mdash;it must be, if you wish it,” said the
inventor, in so low a tone, however, that the
others did not catch it.</p>

<p>“I will look at the boat,” announced Mr. Pangloss
bristlingly, “but I want it distinctly understood
that I do not endorse the principles for
which she stands. Warfare and bloodshed are
distasteful to me, odious&mdash;detestable!”</p>

<p>“Gee, he makes more disturbance about it than
a whole battery of guns,” whispered Herc to Ned,
as the boys and Tom Marlin fell in the rear of
the party.</p>

<p>“Most of these peace agitators do,” was Ned’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rejoinder. “They forget that the rivalry between
nations is not a theory, but a condition. The first
nation to fall behind in her defenses will be the
first to fall a prey to the others.”</p>

<p>“Say,” whispered old Tom Marlin hoarsely, “I
know that whiskered craft Pangloss. I’ve seed
his picters in ther papers. He’s a crank of peace.
He was speaking at one peace meeting where
some one disagreed with him and he busted a
water pitcher over their heads.</p>

<p>“‘I will have peace,’ says he, ‘if we’ve got ter
have war ter git it.’”</p>

<p>“He must be Irish,” laughed Ned. “Seriously,
though, now you speak of it, I do recall who
he is.”</p>

<p>“A celebrity?” inquired Sim, who had been
quite overawed by the fiery manner of the apostle
of peace.</p>

<p>“In a way, yes. He amassed a fortune manufacturing
steel.”</p>

<p>“The material of which warships are built,
eh?” chuckled Herc; “that’s a good one. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hadn’t been for the navy, where would he have
been.”</p>

<p>“Not only that,” went on Ned, “but I understand
that in his eagerness to get contracts he
did not hesitate to stump the country at one time,
advocating a bigger navy and more guns.”</p>

<p>“And now he has his fortune he’s blowing cold
again,” put in Tom.</p>

<p>“Seems so. But just look how attentively Mr.
Lockyer is bending over the old man’s daughter.
She’s looking up at him, too, as if she thought a
whole lot of him. Look at the old man glaring at
them. I’ll bet he’s mad.”</p>

<p>Ned guessed just right. Years before, when
Lockyer was just out of college, he had obtained
employment as a chemist in the Pangloss Steel
Works at Pittsburg. As he accepted the position
more for experience than for the pay, which
was small&mdash;his father allowing him an ample allowance&mdash;he
naturally had some good introductions.
Among the homes he visited had been
that of his employer, where he met Miss Vivian.
She had been deeply interested in the young man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
work, and when the submarine idea&mdash;upon which
he was working at the time&mdash;was complete, he
made her his confidant.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Pangloss had, at first, been glad to
welcome Lockyer to his home. When the chemist’s
father died, however, and did not leave as
large a fortune as had been anticipated, the old
man looked upon the growing friendship between
his daughter and the inventor from another viewpoint.
He had, in fact, discouraged his visits.
That morning was the first time the inventor and
the girl he had grown to love had met in many
months. Her arrival was in response to a promise
made a long time before, that she would be
there to christen the Lockyer when it took to the
water. Much against her father’s wishes, therefore,
they had come. It was Lockyer’s belief
that she would redeem that promise that had kept
him delaying the launching till the last moment.</p>

<p>The purpose of a small platform erected near
the Lockyer’s bow now became apparent. It was
for the fair sponsor of the vessel to stand upon
while she shattered the bottle against the steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
prow, according to time-honored custom. As she
took her place upon the little stand, she gave
Lockyer a look full of confidence and trust, and
a bright light shone in the inventor’s eyes as he
followed the others to the deck of the diving
craft. There was new confidence in his step, his
head was thrown back, and he fairly radiated assurance.</p>

<p>“Better give the word as soon as possible,”
whispered Lieutenant Parry to the foreman, who
stood beside him. “We don’t want to try Lockyer’s
nerves more than necessary.”</p>

<p>Now the ladder was kicked away from the steel
side of the craft. It had been used for the last
time. In obedience to a nod from Lieutenant
Parry, Ned took his place at the deck wheel forward
of the conning tower. The entire front of
the shed had been removed for the launching, and
they could see stretched before them the sparkling
waters of the Sound. In the distance was
the dim blue outline of the Connecticut shore.</p>

<p>“All ready!” hailed the foreman over the side.</p>

<p>A quiver of excitement ran through every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
on that steel deck. In a few minutes now they
would know whether the initial trial of the craft
was to be a success or a failure.</p>

<p>Below, a terrific clattering of sledges started
up. The workmen were swinging their hammers
against the wooden props, knocking out the remaining
retaining wedges. When the last one
was knocked clear, the submarine would begin to
shoot down the greased ways.</p>

<p>“Right below!” shouted a workman from beneath.
Those on the deck knew that his words
meant that only one wedge remained to be
knocked loose.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockyer was gripping the rail, his face
turned toward the platform upon which stood
Miss Pangloss and her father. His face was
ghastly pale, though his eyes shone brightly. His
nervous grasp on the rail whitened his knuckles
as he gripped it.</p>

<p>The girl, a brave smile upon her lips, held the
bottle ready poised. The silken ribbons which
fluttered from its neck moved slightly in the light
breeze sweeping in from the unruffled Sound. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that moment of tension even old Mr. Pangloss
looked interested. The naval officers stood without
blinking an eyelid or betraying any outward
sign of emotion&mdash;as their training required.</p>

<p>“All right!” the command came from Mr.
Lockyer. His voice shook as he uttered it. He
caught his breath sharply.</p>

<p>The foreman echoed the word in stentorian
tones.</p>

<p>“Let her go, boys!”</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>The supreme moment had come.</p>

<p>The hammer fell upon that last wedge. A
sharp quiver ran through the steel structure of
the diving boat. It was the first stirring of life
within her frame.</p>

<p>“She’s off!”</p>

<p>Old Tom Marlin, forgetful of discipline, had
uttered the sharp cry. It had been wrung from
him by the tension of the moment as the submarine
began to move.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>The bottle smashed across the prow. Its contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gushed sparkling and bubbling down her
gray sides. Then, in a clear, girlish voice, came
the words so fraught with meaning to the inventor.
There was not a quiver in the girl’s
voice, though her eyes were strangely bright as
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I name thee ‘Lockyer.’ May you always prove
worthy of your flag, your service, and your
name!”</p>

<p>“Hurroo!”</p>

<p>Mr. Lockyer, coolest of all now, waved his cap
confidently at the dainty sponsor.</p>

<p>The wild cheer came from the workmen. It
was caught up and echoed by the excited men on
the deck of the now moving boat, and went swelling
out on the still air till the crowd outside
caught it up and gave it back with a will.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Pangloss’s iron jaw relaxed as he
watched the inspiring sight of tons of steel shooting
toward the sea at express speed. As Ned
clutched the steering wheel every nerve in his
body throbbed. The exciting thrill of motion
ran through them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Down shot the submarine. As she neared the
water, Lieutenant Parry darted back to the stern
staff. Seizing the halliards, he ran the flag&mdash;rolled
up in a ball as yet&mdash;to the truck.</p>

<p>Sp-l-a-s-h!</p>

<p>The white spray flew high. It descended in
sparkling clouds, drenching everybody on the
deck as the Lockyer shot forward into the water.
Forward and outward she sped, straight and true
as an arrow, her young helmsman holding her
right on her course.</p>

<p>“Hurray!”</p>

<p>The shout came volleying from the crowded
beach.</p>

<p>The officer jerked the halliards. Out from the
jack-staff burst the splendor of the stars and
stripes&mdash;Old Glory!</p>

<p>What a yell went up then. The crowd clustered
on the beach shrieked and danced with excitement
till they were hoarse. The workmen in
the yard dragged out an old saluting cannon and
blazed and blazed away. Even Mr. Pangloss
gave a discreet chirrup which he intended, he informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his daughter apologetically later on, as
a cheer. As Old Glory floated out, all on board
bared their heads, and, turning toward our flag,
stiffly saluted.</p>

<p>Losing her impetus, the Lockyer slackened
speed, hesitated, and then stopped. At the same
instant, with a whirr and clatter, her anchor
roared down, entering the water with a splash.
The latest, most novel submarine was launched.</p>

<p>What did the future hold in store for her?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA.</span></h2>


<p>“Everything is as shipshape as if she had been
afloat for a year.”</p>

<p>A minute inspection of the newly launched
craft, not forgetting a nook or corner, had just
been completed. Once more they stood on the
upper deck. Immediately after the launching
the Lockyer had been left afloat with a crew of
workmen, in charge of the boys on board her,
while the naval party went ashore.</p>

<p>“You have justified my belief in you,” was part
of what Miss Pangloss said to the happy inventor,
as he stepped from the boat that brought them
back.</p>

<p>“I’ll believe in that boat when she does something
worth while,” were Mr. Pangloss’s words.
How strangely this was to be brought about not
one of them dreamed, although Lockyer answered
with a new confidence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“She will, Mr. Pangloss, and when she does
I’m going to ask you for something.”</p>

<p>“I can guess what it is,” was the grim rejoinder;
“but you are a young man still, and do
not come to me till you have ‘made good.’ But
you must not mind if I am rather savage to-day,
Lockyer,” he went on more kindly. “I’ve just
had bad news. While we were down this way I
visited my summer residence at Sandbeach, ten
miles from here. In the absence of my caretaker
it has been robbed by Sound pirates of
every stick of furniture.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me!” exclaimed Mr. Lockyer.
The naval officers who had heard this last also expressed
their sympathy.</p>

<p>“Just when I am getting ready to start on a
yachting trip, too,” went on the old man; “most
annoying, most annoying. Now Lockyer, if your
submarine could catch those pirates, I’d say she
was worth while.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely wish that she could, sir,” was the
rejoinder. And Lockyer meant it, too. In fact,
there was nobody on earth whom he more ardently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
desired to please than the peppery, irritable
old apostle of peace.</p>

<p>Soon after, the old millionaire and his daughter
left. But what a change had come over
Lockyer! All the doubt and uncertainty of the
past anxious months had left him. He could
hardly keep his eyes off the visualized realization
of his dream. At the hotel where they had lunch
quite a crowd had gathered. Every one was
eager to shake his hand and tell the inventor how
they had always believed in him,&mdash;even those
who had been most confident that the Lockyer
would only take one dive, and that would be to
the bottom.</p>

<p>The first thing the shore party did was to don
dry clothing, which, it may be said, was also done
by those on board the craft. The platform deck
would be awash in bad weather, and, as the
Lockyer lay at anchor, it was not more than two
feet above the gently lapping waves. The warm
sun, however, soon dried off the plates.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the party did not linger
over their meal. It was hastily dispatched and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
return at once made to the submarine. Several
of the curious crowd still lingered. Among them
were several persons with field glasses. They
eyed the queer-shaped floating thing with avidity.
As our party shoved off, another cheer was
given, which Mr. Lockyer and the officers replied
to by waving their caps.</p>

<p>The hearts of all were light and felt as if a
load had been lifted from them. However, much
stern work lay ahead before the Lockyer could
be called a complete success.</p>

<p>As soon as they set foot on board once more,
Mr. Lockyer called the workmen about him and
thanked all heartily for their share in the success
that had crowned the day.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’d ’a’ done anything fer you, Mister
Lockyer!” exclaimed one burly fellow, stepping
forward, cap in hand. “Boys, three cheers fer
Mr. Lockyer, and may he hev the success he deserves.”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, but there
was more serious work ahead than cheering. The
boat had to be completely cleaned up from forepeak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to the stern. Neither of the Dreadnought
Boys or their companion knew anything of the
further plans of the inventor and the officers. It
was not till late afternoon, in fact, after a meal
had been cooked by Tom Marlin on the galley
stove in the little room back of the cabin, and
eaten on the folding table, that future plans were
explained.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Lockyer, addressing
the officers, when they were all assembled in the
cabin, “my part of the work is over. The
verdict lies in your hands. I take great pleasure
in turning over to you the Lockyer for any tests
you may see fit to submit her to.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parry thanked him formally, and
informally added:</p>

<p>“And I’m sure there isn’t a man here, Mr.
Lockyer, whose respect you have not won, and
who doesn’t believe in you and in your craft. My
first duty, however, is to my government, and
we are here to make a full and impartial test.
To-night, if everything is in readiness, I would
like to have you take the boat out toward the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Rock lighthouse and back. That will give us a
chance to see what she can do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lockyer nodded. Then he and Bowler
hastened off to give his engines a last overhauling,
while the naval party busied themselves in
various ways.</p>

<p>To Ned and Herc it seemed as if the evening
would never come. Seated on deck with old Tom
and young Sim,&mdash;the latter was to form one of
the crew,&mdash;they discussed the wonderful craft
in every aspect. While submarines were not new
things to either of the Dreadnought Boys, a craft
of the complete nature of the Lockyer was a novelty.
They were deeply interested in the coming
test.</p>

<p>Supper was cooked on board and eaten by the
crew. The officers and Mr. Lockyer ate ashore,
the others taking their places afterward. Then
followed a restless period of waiting till it
grew dark and there was little chance of their
being observed from the shore. Mr. Lockyer was
not anxious, nor were the naval officers, to have
it bruited aboard that they intended to put to sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that very night. Such news would have been
certain to bring out a swarm of small craft to
watch the start, and, accordingly, the workmen,
when they went ashore, had been instructed to
say that the trial trip would not take place for
some time. A few trustworthy ones had been
detained on board.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock or later when Mr. Lockyer,
turning to the lieutenant, said:</p>

<p>“If you are ready, Mr. Parry, everything is in
trim for a start.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” was the response. “We’ll
lose no time in getting under way.”</p>

<p>Some time before, the dynamo, which, like the
engine, was driven by compressed air, had been
started, and a soft radiance from electric lights,
screened by ground glass shades, filled the little
vessel. Not a light showed outside her dark hull,
however, with the exception of her anchor light
run up on the jack-staff aft.</p>

<p>“Strong and Taylor, your stations for to-night
will be in the conning tower,” said the lieutenant.
“Mr. Lockyer, your crew, under Bowler, will remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the engine room. I don’t feel that we are
quite familiar enough with the machinery yet to
run the risk of an accident.”</p>

<p>The boys hastened to the conning tower, while
the others remained below to watch the first revolutions
of the engines. First, however, with a
rattle and subdued purring sound, an electric
winch brought the anchor home. The Lockyer
instantly swung to the tide, floating free.</p>

<p>But it was only for an instant. As the word
came from forward in old Tom’s voice:</p>

<p>“Anchor home, sir!” the inventor shoved over
a lever affixed to the after bulkhead of the cabin
space.</p>

<p>“Ready!” he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant bounded into the conning tower,
anxious to have the honor of giving the first signal.
Seizing the lever of the telegraph, he signaled
below to the anxious engine room force:</p>

<p>“Go ahead. Slow!”</p>

<p>Lockyer’s eyes burned, and his lips were so dry
that he was compelled to moisten them as he gave
the lever a shove. Instantly a tremor shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
through the drifting little vessel. At the same
moment a bright flash of metal shone in the engine
room, as the light gleamed on the first revolution
of the crank shaft.</p>

<p>“Head out of the harbor, Strong!” ordered
the lieutenant, gripping Ned’s shoulder, as he
stood behind him. Ned spun the spokes over, and
the Lockyer obediently swung round. Then,
with her engines purring as sweetly as a dozing
cat’s lullaby, the submarine slipped noiselessly
out of Grayport.</p>

<p>Coming forward into the cabin, the inventor
turned a switch which controlled the red and
green lights on either side of the bow. It was
necessary to have these on, as big steamers,
crowded with passengers for Boston, run up the
Sound at night. Besides, the waters are usually
pretty well dotted with sailing craft and small
coasting steamers.</p>

<p>“Come ahead on your speed now,” whispered
the inventor, slipping up the steel stairway into
the darkened conning-tower. Under the starlight
the broad Sound, gently heaving, lay before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
them. Ned’s hand slid to the telegraph.
In instant response to the signal, the triple
screws of the Lockyer began to churn the water
faster.</p>

<p>“Fifteen knots!” exclaimed the inventor, gazing
at the speed indicator, which was illuminated
by a hooded light, “and we haven’t begun to go
yet. Wait till that engine gets limbered up.”</p>

<p>“Keep her east and a little north,” ordered the
officer, peering into the binnacle, “we’ll pick up
the light on that course.”</p>

<p>Forward forged the Lockyer with hardly a
vibration. So easily did she ride, in fact, that it
was difficult to realize the speed at which they
were proceeding. Lockyer, his face aglow, kept
running up and down the ladder between the
engine room and the conning-tower.</p>

<p>“We’ve cut off the gas now,” he said when he
returned from one of these errands; “we are
now proceeding under compressed air alone.”</p>

<p>“And the speed hasn’t dropped a hundredth
part of a knot!” exclaimed the officer, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at the speed indicator. “Lockyer, she’s a
marvel.”</p>

<p>“Officially?” said the inventor with a happy
laugh.</p>

<p>“Well-er no. It’s a bit early for that, you
know,” rejoined the officer cautiously. He knew
that the Navy Department would require far
more rigid and extended tests before they would
pay out money for a contract.</p>

<p>“There’s clear sea-way ahead. Not a light
to be seen, sir,” said Midshipman Stark presently.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Stark,” rejoined the lieutenant.
“Strong, let’s have a little more speed.
That is, if it won’t strain the engines, Mr. Lockyer.
They’re new and stiff yet.”</p>

<p>“But capable of their best efforts almost,” cried
the delighted Lockyer.</p>

<p>There was a slight click as Ned shoved the
telegraph over once more.</p>

<p>They could fairly feel the impulse then. As
her propellers bit into the water the submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
gave a leap forward, almost like a pickerel after
a plump frog.</p>

<p>“Jumping Jobberwocks! feel her go,” muttered
Herc to old Tom Marlin, as the two stood down
at the foot of the ladder, ready to transmit any
messages from the conning-tower above.</p>

<p>Andy Bowler, the foreman, poked out a grinning
face from his engine room. He was wiping
his hands on a bit of waste and drawing his first
free breath.</p>

<p>“She’s a daisy,” he breathed, and the words,
meaningless in themselves, conveyed his deep
feeling. Then he dodged back again.</p>

<p>“Douse her with oil, boys,” he ordered his
crew; “remember she’s new and her bearings
are stiff.”</p>

<p>For some time they ran on thus, occasionally
turning in wide circles and cutting figure-eights
to test her general handiness. All at once the
inventor turned an anxious face to the naval
officers.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, and his voice quavered
strangely, “you have seen what she can do on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the surface. But we must not forget that the
Lockyer was built for diving.”</p>

<p>In the dim radiance shed by the binnacle they
could see that Lockyer’s face was furrowed and
ghastly. Yet he did not shrink from the supreme
test.</p>

<p>“Is she ready to dive?” asked Lieutenant
Parry, without a flicker of the smallest facial
muscle. He might have been asking the most
ordinary question.</p>

<p>“As ready as she’ll ever be,” was the rejoinder.
“If you say the word, we’ll submerge her. I&mdash;I
must know.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” was the hearty reply; “we’ll
soon find out what sort of a fish the Lockyer
is. Boys, get everything ready for diving. I’ll
take the wheel.”</p>

<p>Ned sped below, and he and his comrades at
once set about getting things in readiness for
the great test. They had been well drilled in
this ashore, and knew exactly what to do. First,
the sailing lights were turned off. Then, in came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the long, sky-pointing fingers of the periscope
and the air tube.</p>

<p>In the engine room the heaters of the compressed-air
containers were started up, and the
gauges soon showed how the air was expanding
under the heat. At a touch of a button fans
were set whirring so as to keep the air pure as
long as possible, and economise on their spare
supply. Every bolt and rivet of the conning-tower
and torpedo tubes were seen to. At last
all was in readiness.</p>

<p>“All right below, sir!” hailed up Ned, when
everything had been attended to.</p>

<p>“S-w-i-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-h!”</p>

<p>A hissing sound filled the boat as the lieutenant,
with a turn of his wrist, set in motion the machinery
which filled the submerged tanks. Beneath
their feet they could feel the little vessel
begin to settle as the weight grew heavier.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Herc, “suppose she doesn’t
come up again?”</p>

<p>“Jee-rus-a-hos-o-phat!” cried old Tom, “this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
goin’ down in a new-fangled craft like this gives
me the creeps alright.”</p>

<p>Ned said nothing, but his heart beat with unpleasantly
strenuous leaps. Slowly, deliberately,
like a wounded water-thing, the submarine settled.
Now the waves were awash of her tower,
and presently the water was rising about the
thick lenses.</p>

<p>A perceptible chill was manifest in the air, and
always sounded in their ears that ominous, swishing,
rushing sound. At last, to Ned’s intense
relief, the tanks were filled. A glance at the submarine
gauge, on the wall of the cabin, showed
that they were already twenty feet down.</p>

<p>“Hang on, everybody,” came a hail from the
conning-tower, “we’re going to dive!”</p>

<p>“Good land!” gasped Herc, “it’s all off now.
Wish I was back on the farm.”</p>

<p>Standing wedged beside the officers in the narrow
conning-tower, Channing Lockyer breathed
a silent prayer. The fruition or the blasting of
his hopes was at hand. The moment was more
fraught with stress than any he had ever known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, the swishing sound came again. A
lever, shoved over on its quadrant by the young
naval officer, had set the compressed air at work,
driving the water out of the stern tanks. As they
emptied, the boat pitched by her head till she
sloped at quite a steep angle.</p>

<p>“Hang on with your toe-nails,” yelled old Tom,
“here she goes! Down to the tie-ribs of the
earth!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the engines began their song once
more. Down&mdash;down&mdash;driven by the force of
her triple screws, the Lockyer dived. Into the
dark profundities they shot, down amidst the
hidden mysteries of the sea, while their pulses
beat wildly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SCHOONER, AHOY!</span></h2>


<p>With her company silent as graven images at
the sheer wonder of it, the submarine continued
her plunge into the depths. Up in the conning-tower
Lockyer clutched a hand-rail, holding on
till his nails dug into his flesh. Every sense
within him was singing an anthem of praise. His
diving torpedo boat was, indeed, proving herself
worthy of the confidence he had placed in
her.</p>

<p>“Better set her on an even keel now!” he reminded
Lieutenant Parry, presently.</p>

<p>Till that moment the officer had forgotten
everything but the wonderful fact that the boat
was diving&mdash;diving as if she had never been used
to anything else.</p>

<p>Instantly the officer set the needful machinery
in motion, and silently the after tanks began to
fill. The water was sucked in through the sea-valves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with hardly a sound, now that they were
running where the pressure of the water was
more intense. Fifty feet now showed upon the
gauge. Lieutenant Parry scanned the chart in
front of him, illuminated by a hooded light.</p>

<p>“We’ve got plenty of sea room under our keel,”
he said; “the chart gives us 400 fathoms here.
Lockyer, I’m glad, old man, for your sake, and
for the sake of somebody else.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Lockyer simply, and though
they could not see his face, they knew that it
softened as he thought of the girl who had christened
his diving boat.</p>

<p>“Here, boys, come up in the conning-tower,”
ordered the naval officer presently, “Mr. Stark
and I want to take a look about below.”</p>

<p>So it came about that, presently, Ned had the
wheel once more in his hands. “What’s the
course, sir?” he inquired, as the officer relinquished
the spokes.</p>

<p>“Two points north of west,” was the response;
“keep her on it till further orders.”</p>

<p>Ned saluted, and the officer went below, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the young steersman, Herc, Tom Marlin, and
Sim in the conning-tower.</p>

<p>It was an eerie, strange feeling, this, of steering
such a craft through the inky expanse spread
about. Viewed through the lenses of the tower,
the blackness seemed almost solid. Through the
inky depths the submarine, a blind, swift-moving
monster, nosed her way. Not so swift-moving
now though, for her speed had been slowed down
to a bare ten miles.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Ned, as the officers vanished in
the wake of the inventor for an inspection of the
engine room.</p>

<p>“Well?” sighed Herc, “how about you?”</p>

<p>“It’s great,” cried Ned enthusiastically; “I
tell you though, it gives a fellow a funny feeling,
steering right ahead into the darkness. Seems
as if you were butting into something solid all
the time.”</p>

<p>“W-w-w-what would happen if we ran into a
water-logged hull?” asked little Sim, with a bit
of a quaver in his voice.</p>

<p>“Or hit a weak-fish?” chuckled Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you, lads,” put in old Tom solemnly, “if
we ever hit a wreck goin’ at this clip, it would
be either the wreck, or us. With chances in favor
of the wreck.”</p>

<p>“Reckon that’s so,” rejoined Ned, with a bit
of a nervous catch in his voice; “we’d crumple
up like a busted egg-shell.”</p>

<p>“Not much doubt of that, lad,” agreed the old
tar, in a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>“Oh say, you fellows ought to have been undertakers,”
exclaimed Herc, impatiently; “for my
part,&mdash;rattlesnakes and rickshaws! I’m going to
enjoy the ride and not worry about what might
happen.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” heartily rejoined Ned; “it’s
no use worrying about what might happen. Suppose
Dewey had worried about that at Manila.
If you want to do any supposing, just suppose
that we are creeping along now up under a hostile
battleship. Presently, we will be ordered forward
into the torpedo-room, and at the word of
command we’ll launch one of our Whiteheads.
We wouldn’t hear a sound, but as we sneaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
off we’d know that we’d justified our existence.
Done what we were built for.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we change the subject,” suggested
the red-headed lad; “let’s talk about the farm.
Wouldn’t old gran’pa be scared if we had him
down here?”</p>

<p>“Not any more so than he was that time he fell
into the well, I imagine,” laughed Ned. “Isn’t
it wonderful, though, old fellow, to think that not
more than a year ago we were doing fall plowing,
and now here we are, down fifty&mdash;no fifty-two
feet&mdash;under the waves&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And plowing along still,” grinned Herc, “but
we’ve got 3,000 horse-power behind us now instead
of being hitched on to that spavined old
mare and the green, wall-eyed colt.”</p>

<p>Down below, the officers and Mr. Lockyer were
here, there and everywhere; testing, tapping, trying.
But there did not seem to be a hitch. Every
joint was as tight as a drum under the terrific
pressure now exerted on the steel sides, and, except
for the “sweating” of the steel, the boat was
as dry as a bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Stepping to the compressed-air gauges, the inventor
scanned them carefully. One of them
showed a slight decrease in pressure. Once more
the electric radiators were put into action, expanding
the air at once.</p>

<p>“How’s the engine?” asked Lieutenant Parry,
pausing by Andy Bowler, as he bent above the
shining, moving bits of mechanism, each sliding
and flashing in and out at its own appointed
time.</p>

<p>“Running sweet as a baby’s sleep, sir,” was the
whimsical response; “we’ve got her well doused
with oil, and there’s not a bearing that’s even
warm.”</p>

<p>“Pretty good for a new engine, eh, Mr.
Parry?” smiled Channing Lockyer.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, sir,” was the response; “I must
say, that from what I have seen, that your compressed-air
engine has an electric one beaten
fifteen ways for submarine use.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s only one thing left to complete
this part of the programme,” said the lieutenant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
as they sank down on the comfortable leather-upholstered
seats in the cabin.</p>

<p>“And that is?” asked Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>“To rise again, to be sure,” struck in the inventor.</p>

<p>Up in the conning-tower the boys could hear
the conversation below distinctly.</p>

<p>“Hammocks and humming birds!” gasped
Herc, “blessed if I hadn’t quite forgotten about
the rising part of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite important, though,” said Ned, with
a dry smile.</p>

<p>“Above there!” came a sudden hail from below
in Lieutenant Parry’s voice.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” bawled back Ned.</p>

<p>“Do you understand how to work the air-changing
device?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then set it in motion, please. We wish to
test how quickly we can get a fresh supply.”</p>

<p>Ned reached above his head, and turned a
valve, which, by an ingeniously simple arrangement,
opened the exhaust valve by which the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
air was driven out and admitted a fresh supply
at the same time.</p>

<p>“I did begin to notice the air getting a little
stale,” commented Herc; as he did so, “Ah-h-h-h-h!”
he exclaimed the next instant, throwing
out his chest and inflating his lungs with the
fresh air which, as if by magic, flooded the place,
“that’s as good as a sea breeze.”</p>

<p>And so they all agreed. The air had been
getting fouler than they had really noticed in
their intense concentration on the running of the
boat.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lieutenant below, “there’s no
doubt about that device working as well as everything
else about the Lockyer. And now let us see
about getting to the surface. We must, according
to my calculations, be not far off the light by
this time.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Mr. Lockyer, with a
confident smile. “It’s ho! for the surface. And
here, gentlemen,” he said, producing a long,
shiny bit of metal with a slot on one end, “is the
means by which we are to get there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, he stepped to the side of the cabin
where, against the wall, appeared the top of a
valve. Fitting the slot of the wrench over this
projection, he gave a gentle twist. Instantly a
swishing sound followed, not unlike the loud
screaming hiss of escaping steam from the safety
valve of a locomotive.</p>

<p>“The biggest air pumps we have are now at
work driving out the water from all the tanks
simultaneously,” he explained; “the water is being
expelled at the rate of hundreds of gallons
a minute.”</p>

<p>“Queer we don’t feel that we are rising,” commented
the naval officer; “the balance in this
boat seems to be better preserved than in the
present type. She does not tip or tilt at all on
her upward way.”</p>

<p>“Yet we are rising,” said the inventor. He
pointed to the depth indicator.</p>

<p>Its hand was rising rapidly. First, it showed
thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then five feet.</p>

<p>“We’re awash, sir,” came a surprised hail
from the conning-tower the next instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course we are,” cried Channing Lockyer
delightedly. “I didn’t tell you boys we were
going to rise, because I wished to try to take
you by surprise. I see I have succeeded in doing
so.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have,” rejoined Ned; “why, I
couldn’t even feel any noticeable shifting of the
course.”</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, come on deck and see the
stars,” smiled Channing Lockyer, leading the
way up the steel ladder. In a jiffy he had the
cover of the conning-tower opened, and out they
stepped upon the wet decks. A gentle swell was
running, upon which the slowly moving submarine
rose and fell evenly.</p>

<p>“Why this is the very poetry of motion!” cried
Lieutenant Parry delightedly.</p>

<p>Above the party shone the steady stars, brightly
reflected on the heaving expanse of waters,
as if they would twinkle a welcome to this visitor
from old Neptune’s realm. For a few seconds
the sheer exultation of it filled them to the exclusion
of all else. Then Mr. Lockyer, poking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
his head over the conning-tower top, ordered
some more speed.</p>

<p>Obediently the little diver forged ahead, her
swifter motion now sending the spray flying back
over her decks&mdash;or, rather, back. But not one of
the absorbed party on the surface minded that.
Clinging to the handrails round the edge of
the tower, they were enjoying every minute of
it, when there came a sudden hail from the naval
officer.</p>

<p>“What’s that dead ahead there? It looks like
a schooner’s sails blotting out the stars.”</p>

<p>“I see it,” rejoined the inventor, “it is a vessel
of some sort.”</p>

<p>“And without lights,” said Midshipman Stark;
“as naval officers we ought to give them a warning,
sir.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Lockyer?” asked the officer;
“shall we overhaul them and give them a
surprise?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” was the answer; “this craft
was built for duty on the high seas, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hand me out the night glasses, Strong, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
you,” said the inventor; “there’s a strange sail
ahead.”</p>

<p>“It’s a schooner, all right, and a fast one, too,”
said Mr. Lockyer the next instant. Lieutenant
Parry and the midshipman soon confirmed this
judgment. A great spire of dark canvas was
now visible against the night.</p>

<p>“Better bear up on her, Strong,” ordered the
naval officer; “schooners without lights in these
waters are a menace to navigation.”</p>

<p>Ned could see the dim outline of this strange
craft through the lenses, and at once spun his
wheel over and headed for the dark boat.</p>

<p>“Schooner, ahoy!” shouted Lieutenant Parry,
as they came within hailing distance; “where
are your lights?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and the swish of the
water under her forefoot, and the creak of the
straining rigging, as the sailing craft forged
along, were the only sounds that broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>“Ahoy there, schooner!” came another hail.
Then in a sharper voice. “Lie to, there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>For all the rejoinder that came back the
schooner might as well have been a ghostly craft
manned by phantoms. Only the occasional creak
of a block came from her.</p>

<p>“Lay alongside of her, Strong,” ordered the
officer, in a sharp voice; “it begins to look as if
there really were something wrong aboard her.”</p>

<p>Ned obeyed instructions, and soon there was
not more than ten feet of water between the sailing
craft and the submarine.</p>

<p>“Try them again, sir,” suggested Mr. Stark.</p>

<p>“Confound them,” grunted the officer; “they
must be a crew of deaf mutes.”</p>

<p>He placed his hands to his mouth funnel-wise
and gave another sharp hail.</p>

<p>“Ahoy there, schooner, we want to speak to
you.”</p>

<p>The answer was as startling as it was unexpected.
A sudden red flare cut through the night.
Then came the whistle of a bullet, followed by a
sharp report.</p>

<p>“Take that, curse you!” came from a man
whose head showed for an instant above the
schooner’s stern rail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FIGHTING SOUND PIRATES.</span></h2>


<p>“Wow!” cried Herc from the conning-tower;
“how the bees hummed.”</p>

<p>Luckily this was all the damage the bullet did,
though they could hear it strike one of the after
plates with a ringing sound. A grim look came
over Lieutenant Parry’s face.</p>

<p>“See here, my man!” he hailed. “You’d better
heave to, and look sharp about it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, run along and play,” came the derisive
answer; “we ain’t got time to monkey with you
little gasolene fellows.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t seen yet that we are a submarine,”
whispered the officer to Mr. Lockyer;
“let’s have some fun with them. They think we
are only some cheeky little launch.”</p>

<p>The inventor was nothing averse to giving the
rascals a good scare, and accordingly, amid a torrent
of profanity from the schooner’s rail, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
party that had occupied the deck crawled inside
the conning-tower. The manhole was clamped
down and everything prepared for a dive. The
lieutenant took the wheel, as in case of any accident
happening he felt that the responsibility
should rest upon him. But he didn’t intend any
accident to happen if he could help it.</p>

<p>Down shot the submarine obediently, as her
forward tanks were filled. She was submerged
till she was about ten feet under water, and then
run straight ahead on an even keel.</p>

<p>“I guess we are about ready for our surprise
party now,” announced the lieutenant, who had
gauged the distance as accurately as he could.
“Strong, you get ready to throw that manhole
open when we bob up to the surface; we’ll give
those fellows a good scare.”</p>

<p>Click!</p>

<p>The mechanism to bring the little vessel up
was put into operation, and so strongly were the
pumps set to work that she bobbed up from the
depths like an empty bottle. The schooner had
before lain on their starboard hand. Her dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
outlines now showed up to port. They had traveled
completely under her.</p>

<p>“Now then, give them a hail!” ordered the
officer.</p>

<p>“Schooner, ahoy!”</p>

<p>It was given with all the power of the united
lungs of Ned, Herc, old Tom, and Sim.</p>

<p>The occupants of the submarine were almost
doubled with laughter at the puzzled, confused
uproar that then ensued on board the schooner.
Evidently, there were several men on board her.</p>

<p>“There’s that pesky launch again,” came a
voice through the night; “give ’em another shot,
Bill.”</p>

<p>“Where in blazes are they,” was the indignant
response, as Bill evidently peered in the direction
in which the submarine had last been seen.</p>

<p>“I’m going to run in alongside and board
her,” whispered the lieutenant, taking advantage
of the excitement on board the sailing vessel.
“Do you hear, on deck there?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir,” responded Ned; “we’re all ready.”</p>

<p>“Then look out. Stand by to jump on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
when I give the word. Don’t stand for any nonsense.
I’ve an idea those fellows have been up
to some mischief. At any rate, a schooner that
carries no lights and whose crew open fire on
anyone who inquires her business, has only herself
to blame if she is held up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the wheel,” volunteered Mr. Lockyer,
as they crept closer and closer to the
schooner. They were now on the lee side of the
craft, and the slight leeway she was making was
bringing her down upon them. Her crew, apparently,
were all busy looking off to the weather
quarter, trying to make out some sign of the
launch that had so mysteriously vanished.</p>

<p>“Strictly speaking, I suppose,” said the naval
officer, as he and Midshipman Stark joined the
others on deck, “strictly speaking, I guess we’ve
not much right to board that fellow, but&mdash;here
goes!”</p>

<p>As he spoke the steel side of the diving vessel
grazed the side of the schooner for an instant.
Before the others were aware of what he intended
to do, Lieutenant Parry had caught at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sailing vessel’s shrouds and swung himself
aboard.</p>

<p>At the same instant, by a stroke of ill luck,
the wind hauled round, and the awkward
schooner yawed off till quite a space separated
the submarine from her. Now, it is a curious
thing that up to that moment not one of the
party had realized that there was not a weapon
on board the Lockyer.</p>

<p>“Not even a bean-shooter,” wailed Herc.</p>

<p>“There’s a butcher knife in the galley,”
chortled Ned.</p>

<p>In the excitement, they had forgotten this utterly,
and now Lieutenant Parry stood alone on
the schooner’s deck, unarmed and facing desperate
men. True, they could get alongside again
in a moment, but if the crew of the schooner was
numerous and well armed, it was likely that they
might have a tough time in boarding her.</p>

<p>“Bother the luck!” grunted Midshipman
Stark; “lay alongside again, will you, Mr. Lockyer.
It may not be too late yet.”</p>

<p>Noiselessly as before, the submarine crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
through the water, once more nearing the side
of the sailing craft. But as they hauled closer
and closer alongside, an unlucky stumble of the
beleaguered officer upset a tin baling tub. The
unusual noise brought one of the schooner’s men
to the lee side. Instantly he saw the approaching
submarine. Leveling a rifle he carried, he
was about to fire at the huddled group on the deck
when the lieutenant, springing out from behind
a cask where he had been crouching, caught the
fellow a blow on the jaw that sent him sprawling
backward. Like a flash, the naval officer leaped
forward, seized the fellow’s weapon, and before
any of the schooner’s crew realized what had
occurred, he had the weapon leveled.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Noiselessly as before, the submarine crept through the water, once

</div>

<p>As they came for him in an angry, growling
rush his voice rang out hard and sharp as tempered
steel.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are. The first man who
moves is going to get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Consarn it,” grumbled one of the men; “whar
did you come from?”</p>

<p>“From the bottom of the sea,” was the reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the officer could afford to joke just then, having
the situation well in hand. How long he
could have kept it so is doubtful, for their first
surprise over, the schooner’s crew, numbering
some half-dozen hard-looking characters, began
to rally.</p>

<p>“Go on and rush him, boys,” snarled the fellow
who had been knocked over. “I only had
one shot in that rifle, anyhow, and it’s ten to one
he won’t hit anybody.”</p>

<p>He kept prudently in the background, however,
and none of the others seemed inclined to “bell
the cat” at that moment, at any rate. By the time
they had made up their minds to commence an
attack, the submarine, which had sneaked up
swiftly in the excitement, was close alongside.
Another instant and four active figures leaped
from her decks into the schooner’s rigging.</p>

<p>To the officer’s surprise, for he was well aware
that there were no weapons on board the Lockyer
that night, each figure held in its hand a
gleaming object, apparently a pistol. They held
them leveled at the crew, whose demoralization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was now complete. Some of them beat a retreat
into the little cabin astern, among them the fellow
who had been at the wheel. Her helm deserted,
the little schooner came up into the wind
with a great flapping of canvas, fell off again,
came up once more, and so on for several minutes.</p>

<p>Two men alone offered any resistance. One
of these was the man who had been about to fire
at the submarine’s crew when he had perceived
her hauling alongside. His valor vanished, however,
when he saw the gleaming weapons of the
attacking party.</p>

<p>“You’ve got us,” he said; “I’ll throw up my
hands.”</p>

<p>“You are a wise man,” remarked the officer
dryly. “Strong, oblige me by tying up that fellow.
Now then, sir, how about you?”</p>

<p>Putting the question in a ferocious voice, the
officer whipped round on the other man who had
seemed prepared to put up a fight. He was a
short, squat man, with a bunch of iron-gray
whiskers on his chin. His little eyes glittered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
savagely, but he, like his comrade, saw that it
was no use to resist.</p>

<p>“Reckon you kin tie me, too,” he said. “You’ve
got us dead to rights.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CHANNING LOCKYER FILES A MESSAGE.</span></h2>


<p>In the meantime, the other fellow had been
looking over the side while Ned tied his hands
fast.</p>

<p>“What kind of a launch is that, anyhow?” he
asked in wondering tones.</p>

<p>“It’s a kind of a special duty launch,” parried
Ned, not wishing to reveal the true nature of
their craft.</p>

<p>“Say, she’s a wonder. Up to weather one
minute, and the next sneaking up to leeward of
a fellow. What chance had we, anyhow. But
say, if I’d ever fired at you fellows, there’d have
been one less of you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” answered Ned; “but, you
see, things came out otherwise.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Midshipman Stark had found
that there was a hasp and padlock on the outside
of the cabin companionway. He had quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
snapped the padlock into its fastenings, securing
the men who had retreated below. Naturally, a
perfect chorus of execrations greeted him as he
did this. But equally naturally, they had no effect
whatever on the captors of the schooner, who
were now more than ever convinced that the
men on board her had been up to some nefarious
doings.</p>

<p>“Now then, boys,” said the naval officer, when
all was secured, and the two tied captives lay in
the scuppers, “just lower those sails and heave
to a minute, and we’ll see what sort of a craft
this is.”</p>

<p>His orders were quickly carried out, and with
more alacrity, as everyone was anxious to find
out the reason for the strange behavior of the
crew of the sailing vessel. If they were honest
men their conduct had been unaccountable.</p>

<p>Amidships of the schooner, what was evidently
her hatch, was covered with a tarpaulin instead
of the customary wooden battens.</p>

<p>“Let’s have that off, boys, and see what’s
under there,” ordered the officer. From his station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in the conning-tower, Mr. Lockyer was peering
over the schooner’s bulwarks eagerly. He echoed
the cry of surprise given by the others as the
cover was ripped off with no gentle hands, but
very expeditiously.</p>

<p>“Well, what on earth do you make of that?”
gasped the lieutenant, as the contents of the hold
lay revealed.</p>

<p>It was furniture. And so far as they could see,
costly furniture, too. On the top of the pile of
elaborately carved tables and chairs lay a big
marble statue, its arms pathetically extended skyward.
Poking about in the mass they soon unearthed
a piano.</p>

<p>“See here, my men,” demanded the lieutenant
sharply, turning to one of the bound captives,
who had looked on in sullen silence, “what is
your explanation of all this?”</p>

<p>“Guess the laugh is on you fellows,” was the
rejoinder; “we were moving house for a fellow
who lived at Setauket, but who wanted to shift
his belongings to the mainland.”</p>

<p>“And so you sailed at night without lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
armed, to repel anyone who asked you questions?”
was the sharp rejoinder. “Oh no, my
man, that won’t do at all.”</p>

<p>“Send Sim on board to hold the wheel a minute,
will you?” asked Mr. Lockyer suddenly, from
the submarine, which was still slowly forging
ahead alongside, the tide holding her and the
schooner together. “I’ve got an idea about that
furniture,” he went on.</p>

<p>“You have?” asked the young officer; “well,
come aboard then at once, and bring your solution
with you, for I confess it beats me.”</p>

<p>Sim dropped over the side and relieved Mr.
Lockyer at the wheel, while the inventor clambered
on board the schooner. He bent over the
pile of furniture projecting from the hold for a
few minutes, then stood erect with a triumphant
cry.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he exclaimed. “This furniture,
every stick of it, so far as I can make out, has
been looted from Mr. Pangloss’s home. These
fellows are the Sound Pirates who robbed him.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of this, Lockyer?” asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
officer; “if it is so we’ve done a good night’s
work.”</p>

<p>“I am certain of it. I have often visited Mr.
Pangloss’s home, and I recognize some of this
stuff. If further proof were lacking what do
you think of this?”</p>

<p>He held up a bust, that even in the starlight,
could be seen to be intended for a counterfeit
presentment of the “Apostle of Peace,” whiskers
and all.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho!” exclaimed the officer, bursting
into a laugh, in which Mr. Lockyer and the rest
presently joined; “yes, that is Mr. Pangloss, beyond
a doubt. Now, my men,” he said, with a
change of manner, switching round on the two
bound men, “what have you got to say now?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got nuffin ter say,” growled the gray-bearded
man sullenly.</p>

<p>“Then I have. Listen. This property is stolen,
beyond a doubt. In fact, in my own mind, I have
little doubt that you are the notorious band of
Sound Pirates, known as the ‘Fly By Nights.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
I’m going to head for the nearest town on the
mainland and give you over to the police.”</p>

<p>“Say, who in blazes are you, anyhow?” asked
the gray-bearded man without a quiver in his
voice, but with much frank curiosity. “I’d like to
know.”</p>

<p>“Then, if it will make you tell the truth, I will
tell you. We are preservers of law and order
wherever infractions of the same occur&mdash;and I
guess that describes the United States Navy
pretty accurately,” he whispered, turning to Mr.
Lockyer, who nodded.</p>

<p>“Kind of police, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess you might call us that,” answered
Mr. Parry.</p>

<p>“Wall,” grunted the gray-bearded man, with
great deliberation, “you ain’t goin’ ter get nawthin’
out o’ me.”</p>

<p>After a brief consultation it was decided to
make for Bridgeport and give the fellows from
the schooner into custody there. With Mr. Lockyer
at the wheel, and the others remaining on
board the schooner as a sort of prize crew, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
run into the Connecticut city was made in little
more than an hour and a half. As Lieutenant
Parry had surmised, the piratical ship’s company
were proved to be the notorious “Fly By
Nights,” and when the furniture was examined
with care, it was found to be indisputably loot
from Mr. Pangloss’s home.</p>

<p>When this had been ascertained, and the
schooner’s crew safely locked up, Mr. Lockyer
hastened to a telegraph office, where he sent the
following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Peregrine Pangloss,<br />
<span class="il2">No. 14 West Seventy-second Street,</span><br />
<span class="il4">New York.</span></p>

<p>“Have recovered all your stolen furniture with
the aid of the Lockyer. Does this go some way
toward proving her usefulness?</p>

<p class="ir1">“<span class="smcap">Channing Lockyer.</span>”</p></div>

<p>“But the mystery of those weapons has not
yet been explained,” remarked Lieutenant Parry,
as they sat in the cabin on their homeward voyage,
discussing the exciting incident of the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>To his surprise, Midshipman Stark broke into
a laugh, and the buoyant Tom Marlin could not
keep from smiling. Ned fumbled in his pocket
for a minute, and then produced a brass tap of
the ordinary faucet type.</p>

<p>“Here’s one of them, sir,” he explained, “and
the rest were like them.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mr. Parry,” chuckled the midshipman;
“and it was all Strong’s idea. When
we became separated from you, we recollected
we had no weapons. Strong here had gone below
on a search for some. He didn’t find any, but in
the engine room his eye lit on one of those taps.
It struck him at once that, held in the hand, they
would resemble a pistol, if one didn’t look too
close. Out of the storeroom he got enough to
arm us all, and that they were very effective, you
must admit.”</p>

<p>When the laughter over this explanation of
the “armed-to-the-teeth” appearance of the
boarding party had subsided, Mr. Lockyer spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it said,” he remarked, “that a leading
American characteristic is Bluff. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that’s partly right, but Bluff, mixed with Brains,
is sometimes a pretty strong combination.”</p>

<p>“It proved so to-night,” laughed Mr. Stark.</p>

<p>“Why not call it American strategy?” asked
Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>They had all joined in a hearty agreement of
this characterization when, from Sim, who was
at the wheel, there came a sudden hail.</p>

<p>“Below there! Light dead ahead, sir!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TECHNICALLY TORPEDOED!</span></h2>


<p>“Light ahead?” echoed the officer, springing
to his feet. The others followed his example.
Up the steel ladder sprang Lieutenant Parry, followed
by the rest. Curious faces poked out of
the engine room to ascertain the cause of this
sudden exodus.</p>

<p>Up in the conning-tower it was easy enough
to see the light that had attracted Sim’s attention.
It was an immensely bright light, high up. Below
it were two sailing lights, red and green.</p>

<p>“Jove!” exclaimed Lieutenant Parry, “that’s
a navy craft. See that large, intensely bright
masthead light? That’s the night insignia of
one of Uncle Sam’s ships.”</p>

<p>“Let’s give her a hail, sir,” suggested Midshipman
Stark; “in a way, we, too, are a naval craft
now.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what ship she is?” mused Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Parry, paying no attention to this suggestion.
“I have it,” he exclaimed the next minute. “It’s
the gunboat Brooklyn. I recollect she was ordered
to Boston last week. She’s going up
through the Sound.”</p>

<p>Midshipman Stark repeated his suggestion.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Stark,” said the officer;
“her commander, Lieutenant-Commander Scott,
is an old friend of mine. Wouldn’t he be astonished
to know that we were so close to him!
Why, in time of war, if his was a hostile ship,
all we would have to do would be to dive, and
then torpedo him.”</p>

<p>“I believe we could even creep up and board
him without his noticing us,” put in Mr. Lockyer,
gazing at the bright light which was now almost
abeam of them.</p>

<p>“By George! Do you really think so, Lockyer?
Wouldn’t that be a prime joke? But how could
we do it?”</p>

<p>Nobody had any suggestions to make till Ned
spoke up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I could suggest a way, sir,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it, Strong,” eagerly exclaimed the
officer. “If we could carry such a thing out it
would be a good joke in navy circles for a long
time to come.”</p>

<p>“All the apparatus it would need, sir, would
be some line and a heavy weight.”</p>

<p>“A sounding lead?” asked Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Have you any on board?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Several, and plenty of line, too. But now
let’s hear your plan.”</p>

<p>They eagerly listened while Ned detailed his
scheme to give Lieutenant-Commander Scott an
unexpected visit in mid-Sound. As he unfolded
it, his hearers grew more and more enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Splendid. We’ll do it if you are agreeable,
Mr. Lockyer,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“Anything that will test the capabilities of the
Lockyer boat I am agreeable to&mdash;nay, anxious
to see tried,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Now, lad”&mdash;to Sim, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was steering&mdash;“ring for full speed and get us
ahead of that gunboat. Better run with the turret
awash, so that she won’t see us if they should
take a sudden fancy to have some searchlight
practice.”</p>

<p>A perceptible increase in the speed came almost
immediately following the signal. At the
same time, the machinery for submerging the
craft was put in operation, till the conning-tower
was almost completely under water. The clamps
were tightly screwed, so that in case it became
necessary to make a sudden dive it could be done
instantly.</p>

<p>A perfect knowledge of the gunboat’s whereabouts
were had, even under water, by use of the
periscope. This necessary part of every submarine’s
equipment is a simple variation on the
old camera obscura. A long tube, with a mirror
at the top, projected above the surface of the
water. It offers no more target than would the
slender neck of a floating bottle, and would
hardly attract any attention. Inside the tube are
other mirrors, so arranged as to reflect a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
picture of the waters above, upon a flat, white
surface&mdash;something like the top of a desk&mdash;set
in front of the helmsman in the conning-tower.</p>

<p>Of course, as it was at night, all that could
be seen in the periscope reflector was the bright
light on the gunboat’s masthead, but this served
quite as well to locate her as if it had been daytime,
and they could have seen the reflection of
her whole outline.</p>

<p>They speedily drew ahead of the gunboat,
which was not, apparently, making more than ten
or twelve knots. Forging steadily forward, the
submarine was maneuvered till she was directly
across the gunboat’s bows, but some distance
ahead.</p>

<p>“Is this about far enough, Strong, do you
think?” asked Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>“I think so, sir,” nodded Ned gravely, “and
now, if you think everything is ready for it, we’ll
give them a whistle.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” nodded the officer.</p>

<p>Ned seized the compressed-air whistle’s lever
and sent an eerie scream out over the waters. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
its echoes died out they could see a sudden ray
of light shoot upward from the dark form of the
gunboat, as reflected in the periscope.</p>

<p>“They’ve heard the whistle, and are wondering
what it is. There goes the searchlight!” cried
Lieutenant Parry, as the fan-shaped ray hovered
about for an instant, and then began to sweep
the waters. “Dive quick, before they pick us up.”</p>

<p>Ned sprang to the wheel and jerked over the
sinking controls. Instantly the little of the submarine
that showed above the surface was completely
submerged.</p>

<p>“How much does she draw, sir?” asked Ned,
turning to the officer.</p>

<p>“About fifteen feet, I guess,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll sink to twenty-five, sir, and come up
as near astern as I can.”</p>

<p>Down they dropped, till the gauge showed that
they were twenty-four feet under the surface.
Ned brought the craft on an even keel, and then
began the ascent. As they rose to the surface,
every one in the conning-tower gave a cry of
surprise. So accurately had the Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Boy gauged the distance that the Lockyer came
to the top not more than ten feet astern of the
gunboat. They could see her big counter looming
up blackly against the starry sky.</p>

<p>Forward, the searchlight was sweeping the
waters in every direction. Evidently, that sudden
whistle from dead ahead had got on the
nerves of those in charge of her navigation.</p>

<p>“My, but they must be a sadly puzzled crew on
board the Brooklyn,” chuckled Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>The others were scarcely less amused at the
way in which the larger vessel was helplessly
sweeping the waters in search of the mysterious
cause of the alarm.</p>

<p>“I saw a bear once, back in the Catskills, that
had been stung by a bee,” whispered Herc; “the
way that old gunboat is carrying on reminds me
of it.”</p>

<p>“Will there be any one astern, sir?” asked
Ned of Lieutenant Parry, the next minute.</p>

<p>“Should be a marine sentry by the illuminating
buoy, but I guess they’re all forward, trying to
find out if they’ve run down anything,” whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
back the lieutenant; “but we’ve got to act
quickly if we are to act at all.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, sir,” rejoined the young
boatswain’s mate, throwing back the conning-tower
top without making the slightest noise.
“Mr. Lockyer, will you hand me up that line, sir,
and one of the weights?”</p>

<p>The inventor passed up to the lad a coil of
stout, half-inch rope, to the end of which Ned
rapidly attached one of the heavy sounding leads.</p>

<p>“Now then, sir, if we can creep up under her
counter, I can do the trick,” he whispered, when
this had been done.</p>

<p>Silently, the little sea-tiger crept in under the
shadow of the gunboat’s overhanging stern. Ned
took good aim, and holding a coil of the rope in
one hand&mdash;like a cowboy about to throw a lariat&mdash;he
hurled the lead upward. It swished round
the gunboat’s stern jackstaff, in which a boxed
stern-light was burning, and fell on the other
side, having carried the rope to which it was attached
round the staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant they held their breath. From
forward there came a sudden tinkling sound.</p>

<p>“Ding-ding, ding-ding!”</p>

<p>“Fow-er bells, and all’s well!” came the cry
from the bow, ringing weirdly out on the still
air.</p>

<p>“Wait a jiffy,” breathed Lieutenant Parry.
For an instant they waited in suspense. Then
came an answering cry from the stern.</p>

<p>“All’s well.”</p>

<p>“Good. That sentry was off his post, as I
thought, while we were creeping up,” whispered
the officer; “now then, Strong, are you ready?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I’ve made the end of the rope
fast, sir,” was the reply, as Ned rapidly took a
half-hitch with the loose end about a cleat on
the deck. This done, he made fast the other end
to another cleat on the side of the conning-tower.
The submarine was now practically in tow of the
Brooklyn, the looped rope about the jackstaff
holding the two vessels together.</p>

<p>Ned slipped off his shoes, and then cast his
coat back into the conning-tower. In the meantime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Lieutenant Parry had stooped low, and
tearing a page out of his note-book, had rapidly
written something in the light from the periscope
binnacle.</p>

<p>He folded the paper and handed it to Ned.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” he whispered, thrusting it into
the lad’s hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” rejoined Ned briefly.</p>

<p>Then, with the note thrust into his shirt, he
ran forward, and began clambering up the ropes.
It was no trick at all for the nimble, hard-muscled
lad to gain the afterdeck of the gunboat. His
progress was eagerly watched until the curve of
the counter shut him out from view.</p>

<p>“Oh, but won’t there be fireworks in a while,”
chortled Midshipman Stark, doubling up with
mirth.</p>

<p>“Hush, Stark,” admonished the lieutenant.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>From above there came the sharp ring of a
musket butt, and then an astonished hail.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“That’s the sentry. Strong’s on deck all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
right,” whispered Lieutenant Parry. Then, in
Ned’s voice, there came from above:</p>

<p>“A messenger from the deep sea. I have a
message for Lieutenant-Commander Scott.”</p>

<p>“The explosion is due in about five minutes,
Lockyer,” chuckled the naval officer blithely.
“Oh, won’t Scott be in a fury,&mdash;and he always
declared that submarines were useless in practical
warfare.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A MESSENGER FROM THE DEEP.</span></h2>


<p>“A messenger from where?” gasped the sentry,
as Ned, barefooted and coatless, stood before
him with the paper in hand.</p>

<p>“From the deep sea,” responded the Dreadnought
Boy, with perfect gravity. “Will you
have the goodness to have this note conveyed to
Lieutenant-Commander Scott?”</p>

<p>“You be blowed!” rejoined the sentry, now over
his first alarm, in which he had conceived Ned
to be some sort of sea sprite. “You’re nothing
but a blooming sto’away.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” Ned assured him with unmoved gravity;
“see, here’s the note. I’d advise you to have
it sent forward without delay if you mean to
avoid trouble.”</p>

<p>Something in the boy’s manner impressed the
marine, and stepping forward, he took the note
and scrutinized it carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“This beats me,” he muttered. “See here,
young fellow, you’d better come with me. I’ll report
this to the officer of the watch.”</p>

<p>Ned marched forward with the sentry in a perfectly
docile way. Presently they came upon the
officer of the watch. He gazed at the sentry
and his companion with unmixed amazement.</p>

<p>“Who in blue blazes is this?” he demanded,
gazing at Ned.</p>

<p>“Dunno, sir,” was the sentry’s prompt rejoinder.
“He says he’s a messenger from the deep
sea, sir. It’s a fact that he did climb over the
starn. I think&mdash;begging your pardon, sir&mdash;that
he’s a bit off in the head.”</p>

<p>“That will do, my man. Go aft.”</p>

<p>“Not before he’s delivered my note, sir,
please,” requested Ned.</p>

<p>“What? This&mdash;this boy brought a note with
him?” demanded the amazed officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined the sentry; “here it is, sir.
It seems all addressed regular.”</p>

<p>As the officer took it, Ned struck in once
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you see that the note reaches Lieutenant-Commander
Scott at once, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, I&mdash;&mdash;” began the puzzled officer; “see
here, young man, has this note anything to do
with that whistle that sounded right under our
bows a few minutes ago?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir,” responded Ned gravely, while
the curious watch clustered about him. The thoroughly
mystified officer glanced upward. He saw
and hailed a passing orderly, and gave the note
into his charge, to be conveyed at once to the
commander of the Brooklyn.</p>

<p>“See here, young man,” he said blusteringly,
this done, “don’t try to temporize with me&mdash;how
did you come on board this vessel?”</p>

<p>“I think that note explains that, sir,” responded
Ned quietly, but with adamantine firmness.</p>

<p>His coolness incensed the puzzled officer.</p>

<p>“What the dickens do you mean by your impudence,
young man,” he fumed; “are you aware
that this is the United States gunboat Brooklyn?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, sir. That’s why I boarded her,”
rejoined Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;but, look here, you can’t impose on me,
you know. You’re a stowaway. That’s what
you are. Come, out with the truth now.”</p>

<p>“I never set foot on this craft till five minutes
ago, sir,” rejoined Ned, with perfect truth.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Either you are insane or a wilful
impostor. I warn you, sir, you are playing a
dangerous game. This is a Government vessel,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment the irate officer was interrupted
by a voice from the bridge. Lieutenant-Commander
Scott, in a hastily-assumed bath robe,
stood outside his stateroom door.</p>

<p>“What is all this nonsense, Dacre?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“Just what I’m trying to find out, sir,” replied
the officer of the deck. “Sorry to have awakened
you, sir, but the affair was so mystifying that I
thought it ought to be brought to your attention.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;wait a moment, and I’ll be down there,”
exploded the chagrined skipper, running down a
couple of ladders and reaching the main deck,
where Ned stood surrounded by the watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“This note says,” fumed Lieutenant-Commander
Scott, “that a submarine is fast to my stern.
Listen:</p>

<p>“‘Submarine Lockyer is fast to your stern.
You are technically out of commission.&mdash;Parry,
Lieutenant U. S. N.’”</p>

<p>“Why, there is a Lieutenant Parry in the Navy,
who is attached to submarine work, sir,” stammered
the officer of the deck, more mystified than
ever. “Of course. He is an old friend of mine.
Where is the fellow who brought this note?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir!” exclaimed Ned, clicking his bare
heels together, and coming to an attitude of attention.</p>

<p>“What is the explanation of this?” demanded
the commander of the Brooklyn. “How dare
you have the impudence to forge Lieutenant
Parry’s name? What does all this mean?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better ask Lieutenant Parry,
sir,” replied Ned quietly.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what&mdash;how? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Right under the counter of your ship, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Or, at least, I left him there,” was the staggering
rejoinder, delivered in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>“Young man, if you are imposing upon us,
this will be a sorry night’s work for you,” was
the ominous response, delivered in a meaning
tone, as followed by the deck officer, with the
marine sentry and the rest of the watch trailing
at a respectful distance, Lieutenant-Commander
Scott made his way to the stern.</p>

<p>“Great guns and little fishes!” he exclaimed,
as he peered over the sternrail, “you were right,
boy. But&mdash;how in the name of time&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Ahoy there, Scott, that you?” came up from
the conning-tower of the submarine, as she rode
along in the stern of the gunboat, dancing about
in the wash of the big boat’s propeller like a
cork.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Parry,” was the rejoinder. “This
is a fine joke you’ve played on me. You’ll make
me the laughing stock of every mess and service
club from here to Yokohama.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, old man,” was the cheerful reply,&mdash;somehow
there didn’t seem to be much sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in the tones,&mdash;“but it was in the line of duty, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Line of duty be hanged, Parry. But I’m
willing to admit it was a brilliant idea.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t mine. You’ll have to give the
credit for it to Bos’un’s Mate Strong, who, at
this minute, is standing beside you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you are Strong,” said Lieutenant-Commander
Scott, turning to the lad beside him with
keen interest expressed in look and voice. “I’ve
heard of you before, and your shipmate Taylor.
The Dreadnought Boys, they call you, don’t they?
Well, young man, I have to admit that you have
caught us napping. But such jokes are dangerous
things to play.”</p>

<p>“Especially if the joke had taken place in time
of war,” chuckled Lieutenant Parry. “Come,
come, Scott, don’t be grouchy just because you
have been fairly torpedoed. If there is any
blame, it is attached to me, but when Strong
suggested the prank, I could not help but think
that if we could make fast to you without your
knowing it, that such a feat would go pretty far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
toward proving the value and efficiency of the
Lockyer submarine in war-time.”</p>

<p>Somewhat mollified, Lieutenant-Commander
Scott replied in kind and, after some more talk,
chiefly of a jesting character, Ned dropped over
the stern, and the lines which held the Lockyer
fast to the Brooklyn were cast off.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care to be in that sentry’s place,”
laughed Lieutenant Parry, as the bright mast-light
of the Brooklyn grew dim in the distance.
“Scott always was a stickler for discipline, even
at Annapolis, and he has always maintained that
no ship he was in command of would ever be
surprised by anything afloat. So you see, Strong,
that you have been responsible for what is bound
to become the biggest naval joke of a decade.”</p>

<p>“And now,” struck in Mr. Lockyer, “I think
that it would be a good idea to head back to our
home port and let all hands indulge in a good,
long sleep. That is,” he added, “if no more adventures
happen to us on this eventful night.”</p>

<p>The Lockyer, however, was not destined to
have any more stirring adventures for the present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and two hours later she dropped anchor off
the boatyard, with a highly successful trial trip
to her credit. Channing Lockyer’s dreams that
night were rosier than they had been for many
a moon. And in and out of the fabric of them
floated a face, the face of the girl who had
broken the bottle over the bows of the gallant
little diving boat&mdash;the daughter of the white-whiskered
apostle of universal peace.</p>

<p>Possibly, however, if the occupants of the submarine
had possessed the gift of what the Scotch
call “back sight,” they might not have slumbered
so peacefully. Had they had this faculty, they
would have been able to take in the details of a
scene that occurred at their moorings a short
time after they had slipped them for the exciting
test voyage.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Lockyer’s nose poked itself outside
the harbor before a long, narrow, low-lying
motor-boat glided across the waters. On board
her were two men. One of them held a pair of
powerful night glasses in his hand. Raising
them, as the craft neared the spot in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
submarine had been moored, he scrutinized the
surroundings carefully.</p>

<p>An exclamation of disappointment left his lips
as he perceived that there was no sign of the
submarine at her anchorage.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” he exclaimed angrily. “I
thought you said, Anderson, that she was anchored
right off here after the launching?”</p>

<p>“And so she was,” rejoined the late foreman
of the Lockyer boatyard; “didn’t I see her with
my own eyes? I was in among the crowd, and
elbowed right and left, it’s true, but still I know
what I’m about, Tom Gradbarr. I guess that
Lockyer has stolen a march on us and sneaked
out to sea on a trial trip.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looks,” was the rejoinder.
“Well, perhaps it’s all for the best. They would
have kept a pretty strict watch to-night, anyhow.
It’s bound to be some time before the navy
finally accepts her. I know the way they do
things at Washington. We are bound to find another
chance to carry out orders.”</p>

<p>“That being the case, let’s get back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
island,” suggested Anderson, who, had it been
light, would have been seen to be as pale as
ashes. Something like a sigh of relief had, in
fact, escaped his lips when he saw that the Lockyer
was not at her expected moorings as they had
thought.</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess we had better turn back,” said
the other. He gave the “automobile control”
wheel, by which the motor craft was guided, a
twist, and she spun round like a long, lithe
snake. “We’ve got to get back and put Ferriss
and Camberly ashore, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be mad as hornets when they hear
that we’ve done nothing,” came from Anderson,
as the boat gathered way.</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped,” was the gruff rejoinder.
“Jobs like the one they’ve set us can’t be done in
the wink of an eye.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” replied Anderson; “but waiting
to get even is a tiresome job.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but vengeance is all the sweeter for being
bottled a while,” chuckled Tom Gradbarr, as he
sent the boat spinning through the water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
direction from which she had come. This lay up
a channel, stretching east and west inside the narrow
sand spit, which separated the calm waters
of Grayport Harbor from the open Sound.</p>

<p>The inlet reached for several miles up the coast,
terminating in a shallow bay dotted with small,
barren islands. In the summer there was a
bungalow colony here, but at this time of year
it was deserted. As they reached the islands and
began threading their way among them, a blue
light suddenly was seen waving through the darkness.</p>

<p>“There’s Ferriss now,” exclaimed Gradbarr,
setting his course for the signal. “I’ll bet he’s
wondering if we have a passenger on board.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A “BIG LEAGUE” REPORTER.</span></h2>


<p>The next morning nobody was astir on the submarine
till long after the sun had risen and was
shining brightly down on the sparkling waters
of Sound and harbor. When Ned and Herc
climbed out of the conning tower for a look about
them, the beach about the yard, however, was
already dotted with curious sight-seers, some of
them armed with field glasses, the better to see
what was going forward on the submarine.</p>

<p>The launching of the Lockyer had furnished
the biggest excitement that Grayport had known
for a long time. The early train had brought into
town several staff correspondents from New
York evening papers, the local men at Grayport
having all telegraphed in “stories” the night before.</p>

<p>As Ned and Herc stood gazing shoreward,
they saw a gasoline launch, which plied for hire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
put out from one of the wharves. Several passengers
could be seen on board her, some of
whom carried square black boxes and other paraphernalia.</p>

<p>“Good gracious,” laughed Ned, “here comes
the first enemy we have encountered since we
have been in commission.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” inquired Herc, not unnaturally
puzzled by Ned’s remark.</p>

<p>“The reporters and photographers from the
New York papers,” laughed Ned. “Look yonder,
there’s a whole boatload of them on their way
out.”</p>

<p>“Thunder and turtles, and I forgot to part my
auburn hair!” gasped Herc, hastily diving below.
He was followed more leisurely by Ned.
By this time the rest of the party was up and
about, and in the galley Tom Merlin was setting
about his preparations for breakfast, aided by
Sim, who had been pressed into service as “first
deputy assistant cook and bottle washer in ordinary,”
as Tom described it.</p>

<p>“How about letting the reporters on board?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
asked Lieutenant Parry, as soon as Ned had apprised
him of the imminent invasion of the boarding
party from shore.</p>

<p>“Of course, it will be impossible to allow them
the run of the craft,” rejoined Mr. Lockyer. “I
think, however, that we can extend them all the
courtesies in our power, provided, of course, that
it will not conflict with the navy regulations.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that it will do any harm to let
them have a few pictures of the boat from the
outside, and a general description,” was the reply.
“I’m pretty sure that if we ask them not to
mention certain things about the boat, they won’t.
Reporters are a mighty decent class of fellows, as
a rule, and if they promise you not to do a thing,
they won’t break their words. Besides, it would
be too bad if they had all this trip down here
for nothing.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged that the press was to be allowed
a view of the outside of the boat and to be
permitted to snapshot her exterior to their heart’s
content. But the interior of the novel craft and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
her wonderful machinery and devices were, as
yet, to remain a sealed book to the public.</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen, can we come
aboard?” hailed a tall, young fellow in the bow
of the press boat, as she drew alongside and her
occupants shot keen, interested glances at the odd-looking
craft.</p>

<p>“By all means,” was the rejoinder from the inventor,
who, with Lieutenant Parry, Midshipman
Stark, and the others, now stood on the deck;
“but before you set foot on board I want you to
promise not to pry into anything that we ask
you not to, nor to print anything but the facts
we will tell you.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir; we’ll promise,” came back from
another reporter. “I suppose you’ll show us all
over the craft?”</p>

<p>“From stem to stern?” put in a nautically inclined
pressman.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” rejoined the inventor, with a
smile, as the eager horde hung on his words.
“You see, there are several secrets about the
boat that we can’t give out to the public, as yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to be content with what we can
get, then,” was the rejoinder. “But can our
photographers get a snap of you gentlemen as
you stand on deck?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” laughed Lieutenant Parry, with
the air of a man resigned to the inevitable.</p>

<p>Click! Click! Click!</p>

<p>A perfect fusillade of photographic shutters
snapped, and then the photographers begged for
“just one more.” With great good nature this
was given, the submarine party grouping themselves
as directed. While this was going on, the
shore boat had run in quite close to the submarine
and, unnoticed in the excitement, a man had
jumped from her upon the steel deck of the diving
craft. He was a stout, fleshy man, of middle
age, who, despite his weight, had displayed this
alertness. His eyes, which were keen and shifty,
glanced about him eagerly, as he set foot on the
Lockyer’s deck.</p>

<p>For a minute he was not noticed, but presently
the inventor spied him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, stepping up to him, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I shall have to ask you gentlemen to come on
board in a party or not at all. You will understand
me when I say that we wish to keep you
under our eyes.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a laugh that removed any of the
sting the words might otherwise have had.</p>

<p>A chorus of:</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sir.” “We’re agreeable,”
and so on, greeted his words.</p>

<p>“That being the case, I shall have to ask you
to step back into the press boat,” said Mr. Lockyer
firmly to the fleshy man, who showed no disposition
to move.</p>

<p>“And who are you, may I ask?” shot out the
intruder in an offensive tone.</p>

<p>“My name is Channing Lockyer. I’m the
owner and builder of this boat,” was the quiet
reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, are you,” rejoined the other, with
a harsh laugh. “Well, when do you expect to submerge
her?”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer that question,” replied the inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
good-naturedly. “That is one of the
things I warned you gentlemen about asking.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re pretty well stuck up for
a poverty-stricken inventor with a gim-crack
boat,” returned the other, coolly drawing out a
cigar and lighting it with an easy manner, but
betraying not the slightest haste to leave the
boat.</p>

<p>By this time the attention of the other reporters
had been drawn to this argument and
their voices began to rise in protest at the stout
man’s behavior.</p>

<p>“Say, cut it out there, will you?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do as we agreed to?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do what Mr. Lockyer says.”</p>

<p>“That fellow must think he’s a big league reporter,”
muttered Herc savagely.</p>

<p>Sullenly the fleshy man obeyed the chorus of
protest and withdrew, stepping back on board the
press boat.</p>

<p>“Say, who is that fellow?” whispered one of
the reporters to another. “Ever see him before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I never did,” was the answer. “I’ll ask
Brown.”</p>

<p>But Brown had never seen the stranger, either.
Nor, it transpired, had any of the other reporters,
all of whom were known to each other.</p>

<p>“Better ask him his name,” suggested Brown.
“He’s pretty fresh and may offend these submarine
fellows.”</p>

<p>“No, leave him alone. He may be some magazine
chap,” put in another. “There’s no knowing
how they’ll behave. They think they own the
earth.”</p>

<p>And so the fleshy, offensive stranger boarded
the craft with the rest when the time came, without
being questioned. While Lieutenant Parry
and Midshipman Stark were showing the rest of
the newspaper men about the deck and explaining
such harmless things as the periscope and the
torpedo tubes to them, this stranger sought out
Channing Lockyer.</p>

<p>“I guess I owe you an apology Mr. Lockyer,”
he said, “for my brusqueness. I’m sorry. Will
you accept my apology?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said Mr. Lockyer
pleasantly enough, but turning away. Somehow
he felt an instinctive repulsion to this person.</p>

<p>But the fleshy man pressed after him.</p>

<p>“Have a cigar, won’t you?” he urged, drawing
out a case of the weeds.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t smoke,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Is that so,” remarked the other; “well, you
don’t know what you’re missing. But while the
others are nosing about, I’ve got a bit of information
that may interest you, Mr. Lockyer. Do you
know a man named Gradbarr?”</p>

<p>The inventor, who had been trying to think of
some excuse to get away from the fleshy man, became
interested at once.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he rejoined, “I do. What of him?”</p>

<p>“He is a rascal, I gather,” went on the other
coolly. “I assume this both from your manner
of speaking of him and from a conversation I
had with him myself this morning.”</p>

<p>“You had a conversation with him?” gasped
Mr. Lockyer, genuinely interested now.
“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right here in Grayport,” was the response.</p>

<p>“But I thought he had left town.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you are wrong. He is living
in some well-concealed place on the outskirts of
the town, or so I gathered. But that is not the
point. What I wanted to tell you was that he
came to me this morning and, after some beating
about the bush, requested me to furnish him with
some detailed drawings of what I saw on the
completed submarine, and also with any other
information concerning her I could gather.”</p>

<p>“Did he say what he wanted this for?” asked
Mr. Lockyer, in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“No. But, as he offered me a big price for the
information, I gathered he was in the employ of
persons who are interested in obtaining the information.”</p>

<p>“And did you make an appointment with him?”
asked Mr. Lockyer, with keen interest.</p>

<p>“You appear anxious to know if I did or not,”
parried the other. “May I ask why, outside, of
course, of your natural interest in learning if I
acceded to his wishes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why,” burst out the inventor, whose strong
point was not worldly wisdom, “if I knew where
he was I’d have the scoundrel arrested. He attempted
to destroy my craft before she was
launched, and&mdash;but never mind that. I would
feel deeply grateful to you, however, if you could
tell me where I could lay my hands on him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know myself,” replied the other, “but
I tell you what, Mr. Lockyer, I won’t be going
back to the city to-night. Suppose this afternoon
I try to get track of him. If I succeed I’ll make
an appointment with you this evening, and we’ll
get the local police and run him down.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” exclaimed the inventor
warmly. “I really don’t know how to thank
you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Armstrong&mdash;James Armstrong, of the United
Magazines Association,” was the glib reply.
“Mind you, I don’t know if I will be able to succeed
in finding the man again, but if I do, be assured
I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Armstrong,” warmly replied
the inventor. “It’s very good of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” was the hasty response.
“In this case, as the copy-books used to say, ‘Virtue
is its own reward.’”</p>

<p>With this he strolled off and mingled with the
other news-getters.</p>

<p>“Now just see how one can be mistaken in a
man,” thought the inventor to himself. “I had
quite a prejudice against that fellow, and yet it
turns out that he may be able to do me a good
turn, after all. I’d give a lot to get my hands
on Gradbarr, for, since I have been thinking it
over, it seems to me that there was more behind
that gas explosion than appeared on the surface.
And then coupling his attempt to destroy the
Lockyer with the previous attempt, it looks very
much as if he were the agent for somebody else.
Somebody powerful and wealthy, who wishes to
harm me&mdash;those Atlas people, like as not, though
I hate to suspect anybody of such dirty work.
If he can be arrested, we may solve the mystery
and at the same time put a rascal where he belongs.”</p>

<p>At this point of his meditations, the inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was besieged by requests for an interview. But
he was firm on that point.</p>

<p>“Write all you like about what you have seen
of the boat, gentlemen,” he said, “but please leave
me out of it.”</p>

<p>“We can’t very well do that, Mr. Lockyer,
since she is your creation,” said a reporter. “But
we’ll let you down as easy as we can.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. The less said about me, the better,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>Soon after, the reporters left, having warmly
thanked the submarine party for their courtesies.
Thanks to Lieutenant Parry and Midshipman
Stark, they had obtained good stories, with just
enough of a dash of mystery in them to make
them all the better reading. As Mr. Armstrong
went over the side, he took occasion to speak to
Mr. Lockyer in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to keep quiet about this,” he
said. “It would get me in a lot of trouble with
the paper if they knew I was spending my time
in any one else’s interests. But I like you, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
don’t want to see such a rascal as Gradbarr get
off scot free.”</p>

<p>The inventor could only thank this disinterested
benefactor once more. That afternoon,
while work was actively going on on board the
submarine&mdash;for after her trial trip there was
quite a lot of overhauling and setting to rights
to be done&mdash;a boat from the shore came alongside.
Ned was on deck at the time and answered
the heavily-bearded oarsman’s hail.</p>

<p>“Note for Mr. Lockyer,” said the boatman,
coming alongside and handing Ned a missive.
“From the gent at the hotel,” he added, “and will
you ask Mr. Lockyer what time I’m to come off
for him?”</p>

<p>Ned hastened below and handed the note to the
inventor. He took it and scanned the missive
eagerly. It was from Armstrong, and read:</p>

<p>“Know where Gradbarr can be found. Meet
me ashore at the old Banta House at eight p. m.
Police will be there. Yours for justice, Armstrong.”</p>

<p>The inventor hastily scribbled an answer in reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and handed it to Ned. The Dreadnought Boy
hastened back on deck with it and found the
bearded boatman resting easily on his oars, idly
regarding the submarine’s structure.</p>

<p>“Here’s the answer,” said Ned, handing the
note to him.</p>

<p>“Is he going to come?” asked the man, with a
sudden flash of eagerness. The next instant, at
Ned’s start of surprise, he checked himself, evidently
realizing he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>“I mean what time am I to come for him?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“How do I know,” rejoined Ned, but Mr. Lockyer,
who had come on deck unnoticed, answered
for him.</p>

<p>“Be here at seven-thirty, my man,” he said.
“By the way, how far is it to the Banta House?”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Ned, in some surprise, “the
Banta House is that old hotel away up the beach.
They built it for a big summer resort, but it never
paid. Too lonesome, I guess. Herc and I walked
out there one day to see it. It’s a curious sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to see that fine building all going to rack and
ruin in the woods.”</p>

<p>The bearded man in the boat had been eyeing
Ned with great disfavor while he volunteered
these details, and he now struck in in a gruff
voice.</p>

<p>“It ain’t so lonesome,” he said. “I’ve bin there
many a time. I’ll be here for you at seven-thirty,
then, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my man,” said Mr. Lockyer. As the
boat was rowed off, the inventor turned to Ned.</p>

<p>“Then you think the Banta House is a queer
place for a man to make an appointment?”</p>

<p>“Unless it’s on some secret sort of business, sir,
I do,” answered Ned frankly. “If I were going
to meet any one there, I’d want to know what
kind of folks they were.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you may have gathered, I have an
appointment there this evening myself,” rejoined
the inventor. “I’m not at liberty to tell what it
is, but it may have very important results.”</p>

<p>Ned nodded. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
Something about the heavily bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
man in the boat seemed familiar to him. He
had met him or seen him before, he was certain.
But where? He could not think. A short time
later he drew Herc off in a corner and described
the man fully to him, imitating his manner as
well as he could, but Herc could come no nearer
to placing him than could Ned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SOME RASCALS AT WORK.</span></h2>


<p>At seven-thirty that evening the boat was
there, and Mr. Lockyer immediately got on board.
Lieutenant Parry and Midshipman Stark had already
gone ashore to visit some friends of the
officers, who lived not far off. Andy Bowler and
some of the engine-room crew alone remained on
board beside the boys.</p>

<p>“Take good care of the Lockyer, Strong,”
laughed the inventor, as he took his seat in the
stern sheets of the little shore boat.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” Ned assured him, “and you
take good care of yourself, sir, for the Lockyer
wouldn’t be much good without you.”</p>

<p>As he said this, Ned could have sworn that
a half smile, which he immediately hastened to
conceal, flitted across the visage of the bearded
man at the oars.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take good care of myself, Ned,” Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Lockyer said lightly, as the oars of the boatman
began to dip and the little craft moved off. Before
long it was almost out of sight, but still Ned
watched it through the fast-gathering dusk.</p>

<p>As he gazed he mused on the strange errand
that had called the inventor ashore to the lonely
Banta House. A more isolated place it would
be hard to think of.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” mused the boy, “mighty queer.
If it wasn’t that Gradbarr&mdash;&mdash;Wow!”</p>

<p>He jumped suddenly erect from the conning
tower rail against which he had been leaning,
and, rushing up to Herc, who stood near by, he
seized him by the neck and shook him violently.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Herc, you red-headed dreamer!”
he exclaimed excitedly. “Wake up, and listen to
something!”</p>

<p>“I will if you take that hand off the back of my
neck,” retorted Herc. “It interferes with my
hearing seriously.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t try to be funny. Listen. I’ve just
thought who that bearded boatman reminded me
of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Adam’s off ox?” drawled Herc easily.</p>

<p>“No, you chump&mdash;Gradbarr.”</p>

<p>“Gradbarr! You’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“I’m certain it was he. That beard was a
disguise. This looks as if it might be one of his
tricks. If it is, Mr. Lockyer’s in about as bad a
fix as he can be.”</p>

<p>Herc was fairly alive now. He literally
crackled with animation.</p>

<p>“Let’s get after them and make sure,” he
urged. “If it is Gradbarr, or any one like him,
we ought to warn Mr. Lockyer at once.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Ned impatiently; “but how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How? Row after them, of course.”</p>

<p>“A fine idea, Herc, but submarines don’t carry
boats.”</p>

<p>“Turbines and tamborines, that’s so. Then what
in the name of the big bow gun are we going to
do?”</p>

<p>But Ned had no answer. If things were as
he feared, they were as powerless to aid Mr.
Lockyer as if they had been on another planet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are we nearing the hotel now?” asked Mr.
Lockyer, as the bearded man, after an hour’s rowing,
still bent to his oars.</p>

<p>“She’s right off thar among them trees,” was
the rejoinder. The boatman jerked his thumb
over his shoulder and indicated a dark grove of
sombre evergreens along the shore. They stood
out blackly against the night sky.</p>

<p>Some distance behind them twinkled the lights
of Grayport, but between the dark clump of trees
and the village there were no cheerful lights to
mark human habitations. As Ned had said, it
was an isolated place, indeed.</p>

<p>“I half wish I had investigated this man Armstrong
a little more before I set off on this mission,”
thought Mr. Lockyer, “or, at least, that I
had brought some one with me. What if this
should be a trap to rob me or to&mdash;oh, pshaw! I’m
getting nervous. Of course, Gradbarr, if he is in
the neighborhood, would not be residing in the
center of a village. Then the police will be there,
too.”</p>

<p>Before long the boatman ran the little craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
alongside a mouldering wharf, once intended as
the pier of the abandoned hotel. Making fast the
painter, he gruffly directed the inventor to step
ashore.</p>

<p>“Mr. Armstrong will be waiting at the end of
the wharf,” he said.</p>

<p>Channing Lockyer’s steps rang out hollowly on
the deserted wharf as he stepped shoreward toward
the sombre grove of melancholy trees,
among which he could now make out the outlines
of the hotel, a huge barn-like edifice pierced with
many dark windows. The wind sighed in a weird
way through the grove as he approached. He
had now reached the end of the wharf and still
no sign of Armstrong was apparent.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask the boatman where he was to be,”
thought Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>He was turning with this intention when, from
the shoreward end of the pier, three dark figures
stepped out of the shadows.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Armstrong,” greeted the inventor,
recognizing one of them; “here you are, I see. I
was getting quite nervous. A lonely place this. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the chief of police here with you? I&mdash;Jasper Ferriss!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jasper Ferriss,” responded one of the
figures, whose faces had hitherto been too much
in the shadow to be recognizable. “I want to
talk with you, Lockyer.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say to you, sir,” rejoined the
inventor. “If this whole thing was a trick to get
me to meet you, we may as well end the interview
now.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and faced the boatman,
who had been standing behind him.</p>

<p>“Row me back to the Lockyer at once,” he ordered
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Not till I gets my orders,” grinned the boatman
insolently. “I’ve got a few scores to settle
with you, Channing Lockyer, on my own account.”</p>

<p>The voice was no longer disguised now, and
Lockyer, after an instant’s struggle with his recollection,
recalled where he heard it before.</p>

<p>“Why you&mdash;you are Gradbarr!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s me,” rejoined the other, “and now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
might as well get this hair mattress off my face.
It’s half smothering me.”</p>

<p>With a sweep of his hand, he removed the
heavy beard, revealing the sinister features of
the former employee of the Lockyer yard.</p>

<p>“You see, you are in our power absolutely,
Lockyer,” said Ferriss, suavely enough, but with
a meaning inflection underlying his words. “Now
what do you say to having a little confab about
the boat?”</p>

<p>“That I would not treat with you for her if I
were starving and you the only bidder,” was the
indignant reply. “Let me pass please, Ferriss.
I’ll walk back to the village.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Lockyer,” rejoined Ferriss. “We
really can’t let you go yet.” He held up a deprecating
hand.</p>

<p>“What, you’d stop me? In that case, I’ll have
to insist. I did not come unarmed.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mr. Lockyer drew a pistol from
his coat pocket, and leveled it.</p>

<p>“Let me pass, Ferriss,” he said, in a determined
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>But instead of replying, the other gave an
imperceptible signal by drawing out his handkerchief.
As he did so, Gradbarr, who had been
standing behind the inventor, gave a quick step
forward. His hand was raised. As Channing
Lockyer’s finger pressed the trigger in his determination
to force a path if necessary, Gradbarr’s
arm descended.</p>

<p>There was a dull sound as the sand bag he
wielded struck the inventor between the shoulders.</p>

<p>With a little choking cry, Channing Lockyer
pitched forward, but, as he did so, the pistol exploded,
its report echoing hollowly against the
dreary walls of the abandoned hotel.</p>

<p>“Confound it! Suppose some one heard that?”
growled the man, whom Channing Lockyer knew
as Armstrong.</p>

<p>“No danger of that, Watson Camberly, my
boy,” chuckled Ferriss, gazing at the senseless
form stretched at his feet. “Here, Anderson and
you, Gradbarr, bear a hand here and get this fellow
aboard the Viper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Ferriss,” said Watson Camberly triumphantly,
as the former foreman of the Lockyer
yard helped lift the unconscious inventor, “well,
Ferriss, did I do a good day’s work? It looks to
me as if Atlas stock will take a jump shortly.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">INTO THE THICK OF IT.</span></h2>


<p>While Ned and Herc were casting desperately
but ineffectively about for some means of frustrating
what they now believed was a deliberate
plot to get the inventor into some kind of a trap,
old Tom came on deck.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, shipmates,” he began; “you’ve shipped
funeral faces. What’s in the wind?”</p>

<p>“Trouble enough and then some,” replied Herc
gloomily.</p>

<p>In response to Tom’s questions, Ned rapidly
rehearsed what had happened and their apprehensions
regarding it.</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled old Tom, when he had heard
him out. “Things look like squalls and no mistake,
and here we are, as helpless as so many
babies. If only we had a boat. A good fast one,
too. One like that fellow has, for instance.”</p>

<p>He indicated a motor launch which was scooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
across the water, her red and green side lights
shining through the dusk like bright jewels.</p>

<p>“Yes, if we only had her,” began Ned, and
then: “Hullo, she’s coming this way. Wonder
if it’s news?”</p>

<p>Rapidly, and watched with what interest you
may suppose, the strange launch approached the
submarine, finally chugging up alongside and
coming to a stop.</p>

<p>“Bother it all, it’s only one of those reporters,”
grunted Herc, in an audible aside.</p>

<p>The young fellow in the boat, which he was
running himself, heard, being possessed of sharp
ears. But, instead of being offended, he burst
into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, only one of those reporters,” he
chuckled. “That’s right. But in this case I have
come to give information, not to ask it. Is Mr.
Lockyer on board?”</p>

<p>“No, we are sorry to say, he isn’t,” replied Ned
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Or any of the naval officers?”</p>

<p>“Nor they, either. Is it anything important?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, in a way. It concerns Mr. Lockyer
particularly. Do you know where he’s gone?”</p>

<p>“No, and I wish we did. He left in a boat for
the shore some few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Then that must have been the row boat in
which he was riding&mdash;that one I passed on my
way out here.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. A bearded man was rowing it?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t see that. It was getting pretty dark.
Bother it all, I wish I could have seen Mr. Lockyer
before he left.”</p>

<p>A sudden intuition came to Ned. Perhaps this
young reporter knew something of the mysterious
business that had taken Mr. Lockyer ashore.
At any rate, there was no harm in asking him.</p>

<p>“To be frank with you,” he said, “we are
pretty anxious about Mr. Lockyer. We learned
before he left that he had an appointment at a
lonely place along the beach. I recollected that
his boatman was a bad character with whom
we formerly came in contact.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you tell Mr. Lockyer?” was
the reporter’s natural inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because my memory refused to come to time.
The chap was in disguise. It was only his eyes
and his voice, which he had altered, that seemed
familiar. Putting two and two together, it looks
as if some mischief was afoot.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” rejoined the reporter earnestly.
“That’s what I came off to see Mr. Lockyer about.
After supper at the hotel this evening I was
walking about the patch of a garden they have
there when I overheard some voices in a summer
house. I did not mean to listen, but before I
could get away I heard Mr. Lockyer’s name mentioned
and then a muttered curse growled out.
That interested me and I soon heard enough to
convince me that the men in there were discussing
a plot to lure Mr. Lockyer to a deserted hotel
and then kidnap him in a motor boat and make
him a prisoner on one of the islands in the upper
part of the inlet till he either gave them the rights
to manufacture his type of boat for a foreign
government, or else till it was too late for the
United States government to bother any more
with the Lockyer boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jumping sand toads!” yelled Herc; “you were
right, then, Ned. Did you recognize any of the
fellows, sir?”</p>

<p>“I heard one addressed as Gradbarr. The
other one, creeping closer and peering through
the bushes, I perceived to be a man who had been
passing himself off as a reporter. He made a
disturbance on the boat this morning. Armstrong,
he said his name was.”</p>

<p>“Then there is no doubt that Mr. Lockyer is
in desperate need of help,” gasped Ned, “but
what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“Go to his aid,” said the practical-minded reporter.</p>

<p>“But a boat. We haven’t one. Say, old man,
I wonder if you’d send one off from shore, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better than that.”</p>

<p>“You will?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We can take this one. I scent a good
story here. Luckily I can run a craft of this
kind to the queen’s taste. Lockyer was in a row
boat. If we get a wiggle on, we may be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to overtake them before they land. You know
where they are going?”</p>

<p>“Yes; to the old Banta House,” responded Ned.
“Here, Herc, dive below and get some pistols;
we may need them. Tell the foreman what we
are about to do. Tom, we’ll need you along, for
we may have a desperate fight on our hands.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a gun of my own,” volunteered the
reporter.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you for helping
us out,” exclaimed Ned. “You happened along
in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me,” laughed the reporter.
“This thing will make a cracking good story and
beat for my paper.”</p>

<p>Herc was soon back on deck. With him came
Andy Bowler. The latter was full of questions,
but Ned only spared time to give him the merest
outline of their mission.</p>

<p>“I guess this is against rules and regulations,”
he said, as they tumbled into the boat, “but it’s
in line of duty, and we’ve got to see it through.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were swishing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the water in the newspaper man’s hired motor
boat&mdash;a handy little craft, capable of doing her
twelve miles without heating up a bearing.</p>

newspaperman’s motor boat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Might as well tell our real names,” laughed
the reporter, as they sped along. “Mine’s Hargraves&mdash;Van
Hargraves, of the <cite>Planet</cite>.”</p>

<p>Ned introduced himself and his companions.
But while he was doing this, his eyes hardly left
the waters ahead of them. Darkness had now
shut in, but on the water there is usually a faint
illumination, even if it is only from the reflected
stars. But on all the expanse ahead of him the
Dreadnought Boy could see nothing to indicate
the boat they were in pursuit of.</p>

<p>“Do you know where this Bantam House, or
whatever its name, is?” asked young Hargraves,
as they neared the shore.</p>

<p>“Ought to be able to pick it up by the big
clump of evergreens about it,” rejoined Ned.
“They are the only trees along that part of the
beach. They ought to stand up against the sky
like a church.”</p>

<p>“If only there was a moon,” wished Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Avast there!” cried old Tom suddenly, springing
to his feet and holding to the gunwale.
“What’s that right on your port bow, lad? See,
off there?”</p>

<p>He pointed shoreward, or, rather, in the direction
in which they knew the shore must lie.</p>

<p>“Looks like a clump of trees. It’s something
black and bulky, anyhow,” decided Hargraves.</p>

<p>Ned, who had taken the precaution to bring a
night glass along, placed the instrument to his
eyes.</p>

<p>“It is trees,” he announced; “a big grove of
them. That must be the Banta House.”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy!” exclaimed Herc. “Now
we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The sharp report of a pistol split the night
right ahead of them. Among the dark shadows
of the grove of trees they could see, for a breath,
a flash of red flame.</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Hargraves. “I guess we’ve
hit the trail of trouble, all right. That was a
pistol shot, and a pistol shot means a story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope it means nothing worse,” rejoined Ned
anxiously. “What can have happened?”</p>

<p>“No use expectrapating (speculating?) on
that, lad,” struck in old Tom. “Better get this
peanut roaster speeded up a bit and be ready for
action when we hit the shore.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready for action right now,” said Herc
grimly, clicking the lock of his pistol ominously.</p>

<p>“Can’t you make this boat go faster?” urged
Ned of the reporter.</p>

<p>The other replied in the negative.</p>

<p>“She’s got all the gasoline and all the spark I
can give her now,” he said. “We couldn’t do an
inch more if a torpedo was chasing us.”</p>

<p>An instant later they ran in beside a rickety
wharf, which, as it so happened, was some little
distance below the one at which Mr. Lockyer had
been landed, and had been intended for trade
boats to land at, while the other had been designed
for the use of yachts and pleasure craft.
To make fast the painter and get ashore was the
work of a jiffy. Under Ned’s directions they
scattered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two shots in quick succession will be the
signal that one of us has struck the trail,” whispered
Ned, as they separated. “Don’t forget
now, two shots close together mean trouble. It
will be the duty of each of us to get there as soon
as possible when he hears them fired. So long!”</p>

<p>He slipped off into the darkness under the
mournful spruce and hemlocks. The others
darted off with equal alacrity in the directions to
which he had assigned them.</p>

<p>But it was Ned who was to “strike the trail”
first. Plunging as silently as possible through
the dark shadows of the overhanging trees, he
presently emerged on what had evidently once
been a driveway. He with difficulty choked back
a gasp of amazement as he perceived standing
there, unlighted and silent&mdash;an automobile!</p>

<p>“Jove! here’s what they came in,” he muttered.</p>

<p>As he uttered his thought half aloud, voices
at some little distance struck into his hearing.</p>

<p>“Bring him along. The machine should be
right here some place. Say, that was a hard tap
you gave him, Gradbarr.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“The better to keep him quiet with,” grunted
another voice, which Ned instantly recognized
as that of the rascally machinist.</p>

<p>There was need for quick thinking on Ned’s
part. Lockyer’s captors were near at hand. In a
few brief seconds they would have the inventor’s
unconscious form in the car. That much was
clear from the fragments of their talk the boy
had caught. In a flash Ned’s mind was made up.
Slipping back into the brush, he raised his revolver
and fired two shots in rapid succession.</p>

<p>As he had expected, there was instant uproar.
The party with Lockyer in custody paused,
startled by the very suddenness of the thing. At
the same time shouts and cries arose from several
points of the abandoned hotel grounds.</p>

<p>While the confusion was at its height, Ned
darted forward, and, leaping nimbly into the tonneau
of the machine, he ran his hand under the
back seat. As he had expected, there was quite
a space under there, and, making as little noise
as possible, the boy crawled into it. Hardly had
he tucked in his toes before a heavy footstep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
came on the running board, and a voice ordered
gruffly:</p>

<p>“Chuck Lockyer in, boys, and look lively. In
some way the police have got wise to us.”</p>

<p>“Police nothing,” came another voice, which
Ned, with a distinct thrill, knew to be Gradbarr’s.
“If them Dreadnought Boys ain’t got something
to do with this, call me a Dutchman.”</p>

<p>Then came the noise of something limp and
heavy being stowed on the seat of the tonneau,
followed by a shuffling and stamping as the members
of the rascally party of abductors boarded
the car. A minute later, just as the amazed party
from the submarine came dashing through the
bushes, the auto leaped forward.</p>

<p>On into the night it roared, a fusillade of bullets
from Ned’s friends spattering harmlessly
about it as it thundered on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A SURPRISE PARTY WITH A VENGEANCE.</span></h2>


<p>For what Ned judged to have been half
an hour, or possibly a little longer, the car
plunged along. Then, as suddenly as it started,
it came to a stop. The conversation of the occupants
of the car was now perfectly audible,
and Ned’s heart beat wildly as among them he
recognized the tones of Channing Lockyer. The
inventor had then recovered his senses, which, as
the boy knew from what he had overheard, must
have been lost following the blow from Gradbarr.</p>

<p>“Look here, Ferriss,” Ned from his hiding
place could hear Mr. Lockyer saying, “what you
are doing is not only dastardly, but senseless. I
tell you now once and for all that whatever you
may do to me, I shall never sign any paper or
make any agreement with you concerning the
submarine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” a gruff voice, which
Ned supposed must be that of Ferriss, responded.
“But I warn you now, Lockyer, not to give us
too much trouble. You are absolutely in our
power. We are about to take you to a lonely
island where we could hide you for ten years
without any one being the wiser. We shall keep
you there till you have had time to reflect whether
it is better to accept our terms for your craft, or
to let her rot uselessly while you are reported
missing.”</p>

<p>“Missing!” gasped Lockyer.</p>

<p>“Yes. Your friends will all believe that you
have been drowned. You don’t think that we are
such simpletons as not to have provided for that,
do you? We have set the boat in which you were
rowed ashore to-night adrift. She is bottom up,
and any one finding her will imagine that she has
capsized. Under one of her thwarts we have
placed your hat, so that there will be no doubt
as to your fate. Your friends will mourn you
for a time as drowned, and then both you and
the Lockyer boat will be forgotten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good heavens, Ferriss!” exclaimed the inventor,
as the full purport of this cleverly concocted
plot burst upon him. “Are you a man or a monster?”</p>

<p>“A little of both,” rejoined the other complacently.
“The Far Eastern nation of which I
told you before needs your boat. We have contracted
to get it for them. We’ll do it, too.”</p>

<p>“But even if I signed your papers what good
would that do you?” asked Lockyer. “Who
would believe you had authority?”</p>

<p>“Everybody,” was the calm rejoinder. “We
would arrange to have you kept a prisoner till we
were safe in the East with your plans and specifications.
The power we have mentioned as being
interested in your boat has the reputation of being
a good friend to those who befriend it. They
would take care that we came to no harm, no
matter what steps you took after your escape.”</p>

<p>“But the United States&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Has far too much to attend to to go to war
over one inventor, my friend. Besides, we have
influence at Washington that you know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of. No, Lockyer, your best plan is to draw for us
a complete set of plans, and then you are at liberty
to go.”</p>

<p>“And let you reap the benefit of my years of
work and thought?”</p>

<p>“We intend to pay you as I told you. Of
course, we should also require a receipt from you.
That receipt of payment alone would absolve us
from any guilt in connection with the transaction.
It would show, don’t you see, that you sold
out your government willingly.”</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” groaned the unhappy inventor,
as he saw the web being drawn more tightly
about him.</p>

<p>“But come, we’re wasting time here,” struck
in another voice, that of Watson Camberly, although,
of course, Ned, burning with indignation
in his hiding place, did not recognize it. “We
must get over to the island. Will you come with
us willingly, Lockyer, or shall we have to bind
you?”</p>

<p>“You need not bind me,” was the bitter reply.
“I cannot see how I could well be more helpless.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad you realize at last that we have the
whip hand,” snarled the voice of Ferriss.</p>

<p>“Gradbarr, you stay here and guard the car,”
ordered Camberly the next moment, after an interval,
in which Ned could feel them leaving the
auto. “We’ll take the boat out to the island and
return before long.”</p>

<p>Ned listened to their retreating footsteps for a
few minutes. As they died away, he heard Gradbarr
walking about the car, doubtless trying to
keep warm, for the fall air was sharp as it
blew in off the Sound. But still as he lay, the
lad’s mind was hard at work. Presently, and
very cautiously, he raised the leather flap which
hung in front of his place of concealment and
peeped out. The guardian of the car was leaning
against the front wheel with his back to Ned.
He was whistling in a low key. Any one seeing
him would little have imagined what nefarious
business he was engaged in. Ned’s mind was
made up in a flash. He must act now, or not at
all. Before long, there was no doubt from what
he had heard, that the others would be back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Gripping his weapon tightly, he noiselessly
slipped out of the tonneau, the side door of which
had been left open. Before Gradbarr could make
any preparations, or indeed was even aware of
what was happening behind his back, the ruffian
was startled by a sudden voice in his ear.</p>

<p>“Don’t move an inch, Gradbarr, or there’ll be
trouble.”</p>

<p>“What!” roared out the startled rascal, and
would have said more, but that at that instant he
felt a certain chilly disc pressed against the back
of his neck, which instinct told him was the muzzle
of a pistol.</p>

<p>“Now do as I tell you,” ordered Ned crisply.
“Get up on the seat of that car and drive back
into Grayport.”</p>

<p>“Into Grayport?”</p>

<p>Gradbarr began to whimper like the coward he
was, as he echoed the words. Also he had recognized
Ned’s voice and knew the lad was not
to be trifled with.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” ordered the Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Boy sharply. “Don’t hesitate, or I’ll give you a
lesson in navy tactics.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’ll be arrested,” whined the ruffian,
still not daring to turn.</p>

<p>“You certainly will,” Ned assured him. “You
have been going a long time, Gradbarr, but here
is where your career reaches a sudden termination.”</p>

<p>“Come on now.” To emphasize his words,
Ned pressed the muzzle of the revolver more
closely to Gradbarr’s neck. The fellow moved
forward, cringing and whimpering, but before
he had taken a step something happened which
completely turned the tables.</p>

<p>Ned felt himself suddenly enwrapped from
behind by a pair of powerful arms, while at the
same moment a harsh voice grated out:</p>

<p>“Just in time it seems.”</p>

<p>Gradbarr whipped round at the sudden interruption
and gave a cry of delight. He laughed
aloud as he saw Ned struggling desperately, but
ineffectually in the arms of his captor.</p>

<p>“Good work, Mr. Camberly,” he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with a chuckle. “I guess I won’t go back to Grayport
to-night, after all.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he aimed a vicious blow at Ned.
The rascal’s fist struck the Dreadnought Boy full
in the face.</p>

<p>“You scoundrel,” flared out Ned. “Set me free
and see if you dare to strike me.”</p>

<p>“Set you free,” sneered the voice behind him,
the owner of which still held the boy’s arms
tightly pinioned. “Not to-night, my boy, and
perhaps not for many nights. Gradbarr, get that
rope that we meant for Lockyer out of the tonneau.
We’ll truss this young turkey cock up and
take some of the fight out of him.”</p>

<p>Raging furiously within, Ned was compelled
resistlessly to submit to the indignity of being
bundled up hand and foot in the rope by Gradbarr.
The former machinist thoroughly enjoyed
his job, as was evinced by the way he grinned
and chuckled as he viciously drew the cords tight.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” he jeered. “It looks as if
I was going to get even at last for the other night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
when you thought you had me bottled up at the
boat yard. Take that, you young sneak!”</p>

<p>He aimed another hard blow at Ned’s face, but
this time Camberly checked him.</p>

<p>“That will do, Gradbarr,” he warned. “Wait
till we get him to the island if you have any old
scores to pay off. You can attend to them there
at your leisure.”</p>

<p>“Won’t Anderson be tickled to death when he
sees him,” muttered Gradbarr. “The dirty
young spy. Just think he was hiding under those
cushions in the tonneau all the time we were
driving out here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make him tell us just how he got there
later on,” said Camberly. “For the present just
run that car into that brush at the side of the
road. We don’t want to leave it standing where
it will attract attention.”</p>

<p>It only took Gradbarr a few seconds to obey,
and then he came back to gloat once more over
Ned. But once more Camberly cut him short.</p>

<p>“You take his feet. I’ll take his head,” he ordered.
“Come on, quick march for the boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, guv’ner, ain’t this a treat,” chuckled
Gradbarr, as he obeyed. “But how did you ever
come to show up in the nick of time?”</p>

<p>“Why, we found when we reached the boat
that one of the spark plugs needed tightening
up,” responded Camberly, with a snicker. “I volunteered
to come back to the car for a wrench.
Luckily I came softly, and arrived very opportunely
for you.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Gradbarr. “It
seems that this young rooster had it all cut and
dried to send me to prison.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll get there yet, you scoundrel,” Ned
burst out, and was angry at himself the next minute
for his exhibition, for Camberly broke into a
brutal laugh.</p>

<p>“My, isn’t somebody mad,” he chortled. “Well,
we’ll see if a little solitary confinement won’t
prove a good cure for a fit of bad temper.”</p>

<p>In a moment more Ned felt himself being
lifted from the ground and carried rapidly
through the woods toward the shore. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
emerged on the beach, a voice hailed them. It
was Ferriss.</p>

<p>“What on earth have you got there?” he demanded,
peering through the darkness at the
bundle Gradbarr and Camberly were carrying.</p>

<p>“Why, a young man who has just accepted an
invitation to a surprise party,” laughed Camberly.
“We’re the hosts.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“SAFE AS IN A STEEL-LINED VAULT.”</span></h2>


<p>Whatever the future may hold in store for
them, it is doubtful if either Ned or Channing
Lockyer will ever forget the moment that they
met on that sandy beach, surrounded in the darkness
by wicked and desperate men. The surprise,
however, was all on the side of the inventor.
His first impulse, as his eyes fell on the bound
form and he recognized it, was to give a shout of
joy. His next, however, was one of regret that
another should have been dragged in to share his
predicament. He had no idea, of course, how the
Dreadnought Boy came to be there, nor had he
an opportunity to inquire.</p>

<p>Before a word could be exchanged between
these two so strangely met, they were hustled
into a small flat-bottomed boat lying on the shore,
and rapidly sculled off to a long, low-lying black
motor-boat which lay at anchor a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
off shore. Once on board, the tender was at once
taken in tow, the anchor hauled up, and, rapidly
as a water snake, the gasoline-driven craft
glided off into the darkness. Whither they were
bound Ned had not the slightest idea. Only one
thing was in his mind. That was a feeling of
gladness that he was at least near to Channing
Lockyer, and that helpless as he was at the moment,
he might yet be able to render him some
service, for Ned was not a lad whose spirits were
easily downed. Otherwise, bound and helpless
as he was, and in the hands of men whom he
knew had every reason to hate him, he would
have had good cause for apprehension.</p>

<p>How long it was before the motor craft
stopped, Ned had no idea, but he knew by the
lessening vibration of her engines that she was
coming to a stop. Presently he heard her fenders
scrape as she was run alongside a wharf. Then
he was lifted up once more and carried swiftly
along a small landing place and hustled off into
the darkness. That they were crossing sand, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
knew by the noiseless progress of the two who
were conveying him.</p>

<p>All at once the dark outlines of a building of
some sort loomed up in front of him. But before
he had time to take his bearings or get the least
idea of where he was, Gradbarr, who had hold of
his feet, dropped them and ran swiftly forward.
Ned heard the sound of a door of some kind being
slammed open.</p>

<p>Then Gradbarr came back and picked up his
feet once more.</p>

<p>“Now then, in with him,” he heard Camberly
say, and before he had time to utter a cry, for,
of course, it was impossible for him to move, Ned
felt himself being held above a black pit&mdash;as it
looked. The next instant he was dropped, into
what abyss he knew not. A cry rang from his
lips, but was stifled the next instant as he felt
himself plunging down upon a floor, which, to his
astonishment, was soft and yielding.</p>

<p>“Sand!” thought the boy.</p>

<p>For one brief instant he could see, through the
still open trap door above him, the bright gleam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the stars. The next moment, with an ominous
crash, the door fell, blotting out the sky and leaving
him in utter darkness. He heard a dull clanking
of metal. Evidently his captors were securing
the door from the outside. Then came a
burst of smothered laughter from above, which
made Ned’s blood boil. This was succeeded by
absolute silence.</p>

<p>Before long, however, he heard footsteps above
him. They rang hollowly, as if on a wooden
floor.</p>

<p>“Hum, so I’m in a cellar,” thought Ned, “and
I’ll bet the hole out of a doughnut that it’s the
cellar of that bungalow I heard those rascals
talking about while I lay hidden in the automobile.
I wish to goodness I’d stayed there a while
longer. I might have been of more help to Mr.
Lockyer.”</p>

<p>Some men, and most boys of Ned’s age, finding
themselves in pitch darkness, bound hand and
foot and without the least idea of where they were
save that they were in the hands of bad men,
would have given way to despair. But this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
not the way with the Dreadnought Boy. For
one thing, his navy training had borne fruit in
giving him unusual self-reliance, a feeling that
one of Uncle Sam’s men must never give up the
ship, not even when he feels her reeling and
sinking beneath his feet. This feeling in great
or less measure is in every heart that beats under
a navy uniform, and it’s a mighty good insurance
for the country that it is so.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Ned to himself, “for apparent
hopelessness this reminds me of that time we
were all in that prison in Costaveza expecting to
be shot. But we got out of that and maybe I’ll
find a way out of this yet. But I must confess
that it looks as if Gradbarr and Co. rather has
it on me for the present, at any rate.”</p>

<p>He wiggled a hand, but if he had hoped to find
any slack in his ropes he was disappointed. The
same test applied to the ropes confining his lower
limbs had no other result.</p>

<p>For some time he lay there in the darkness
thinking up a dozen schemes to escape, all of
which looked good at first, but each proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
be impossible of execution after a moment’s
thought had been devoted to them.</p>

<p>“Wow! as Herc would say,” thought Ned. “It
begins to look as if I was up against it as never
before since our naval career began. I wonder
what the other fellows are doing? They may
have tried to trace the auto, but even if they succeed
in finding it, it won’t do me any good.
They’d never guess that those chaps had a motor
boat.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard voices above him. Evidently
the men who had captured them had come
out of the house.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve imprisoned Lockyer up there,”
thought Ned. “Well, they certainly had their
plans well laid for carrying out their campaign.
Hullo! what’s that they’re saying?”</p>

<p>He listened attentively.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re safe enough,” came in Gradbarr’s
voice. “That kid in the cellar will keep till Christmas,
and as for that milksop inventor, what the
bag began that sleeping stuff you gave him will
complete. Come on you’re as safe to take a run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ashore as if we had them both locked up in a
steel-lined safe deposit vault.”</p>

<p>“That’s no dream,” thought Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re right, Gradbarr,” replied
Ferriss’s voice, “and, as you say, we’ve got
to put back to shore and pick up Anderson&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho, so he’s in this, too!” exclaimed Ned to
himself. “What a choice collection of worthies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d better come along, Ferriss,” urged
Camberly. “Gradbarr will have to take the auto
back to town. And in the event of trouble the
three of us will be none too many.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that that boy’s companions
may have followed the car?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s likely, but still they may
have. There is no doubt in my mind, since we
discovered that young Strong was hiding under
the seat all the time, that the whole gang of
them was on shore.”</p>

<p>This came from Gradbarr.</p>

<p>“But how on earth did they discover our plan
to kidnap Lockyer?” protested Ferriss.</p>

<p>“Search me,” rejoined Gradbarr. “It’s enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
for me that they did. If we had not got away
when we did, we’d have had the whole hornet’s
nest about our ears. As it is, once we’ve got Anderson
safely off shore, no one will be the wiser.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” chuckled Ferriss, seemingly
much relieved. “I hope Anderson did a good job
on capsizing that boat. It’s important that his
friends should imagine that Lockyer is drowned.
And, as I was saying&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But here the voices, which for some seconds
had been diminishing in volume, died away altogether.
Ned realized that the men had deemed
it safe for them all to leave the island and were
now on their way to the boat.</p>

<p>“Now if I only could get free of these ropes,”
he muttered, “I could do a whole lot of surprising
things before they get back.”</p>

<p>The thought that, were it not for his bonds
he could be free and at work to save them both,
rendered Ned almost desperate. He thrashed
about wildly, rolling hither and thither in a frantic
attempt to somehow loosen the knots that
bound him. But Gradbarr had worked around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
shipyards too long not to be able to tie a knot
that would hold. The ropes did not yield the
fraction of an inch. On the contrary, they began
to cut into Ned’s flesh and pain him intensely.</p>

<p>All at once, as he rolled, something struck his
right hand, and a sharp thrill of pain shot through
him.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” he exclaimed, “there’s something
sharp in the sand. Feels like I’d given myself
a bad cut.”</p>

<p>He lay still, then, and as he gave over his
mad threshings about, he could feel the warm
blood trickling from the cut that he had received
from the sharp object, whatever it was. All at
once, however, a thought shot through him that
speedily banished all idea of pain or sense of
injury.</p>

<p>If that object, lying half-buried in the sand,
was sharp enough to cut his hand, surely it was
sharp enough to sever his ropes!</p>

<p>With wildly throbbing pulses and a heart that
beat as if it would choke him, Ned began tumbling
about again. But his rollings and heavings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had a definite object now&mdash;to locate again the
sharp thing that had cut him. He was about
despairing of finding it when, all at once, he felt
something grate against the taut ropes at his
wrist. Rolling over till his weight bore down
on the object he had encountered, the Dreadnought
Boy swayed his body as much as he
could, so as to chafe the rope. Once, twice,
thrice, he wriggled, and then&mdash;oh glory!&mdash;he
felt the rope part with a quick snap.</p>

<p>An instant later he had a hand loose and was
rapidly uncoiling the long rope wrapped about
him. Another five minutes and he was free, but
oh how stiff! Pins and needles shot through
his limbs. He felt quite sick and faint as he
stood upright.</p>

<p>“Here, this won’t do,” he thought; “I’ve only
got a short time to act in, and I’ll have to make
the best of it.”</p>

<p>He fell to chafing his stiff limbs, and soon
had the blood comfortably circulating.</p>

<p>“Wonder what that was that so providentially
gave me a cut fist and then set me free?” mused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the lad, feeling about in the sand as he waited
the moment when he could stir without excruciating
pain. He soon found it, the broken
end of a bottle. Evidently, when the cellar had
been made, the glass object had been left in the
sand. If ever there was an instrument of providence,
that broken glass bottle had proved itself
to be the article.</p>

<p>“I feel like having you mounted in gold,” said
Ned to himself, as he ran his fingers over it in
the darkness.</p>

<p>As his stiffness vanished, Ned rapidly became
a very much animated young prisoner. Feeling
his way in the darkness, he soon came to a flight
of steps. These, he surmised readily enough, led
upward to the door through which he had been
tumbled so unceremoniously. But a short examination
sufficed to show him that it would be impossible
to make an exit that way. It was, evidently,
clamped too firmly on the outside for it
to be a feasible project to open it.</p>

<p>Rather cast down at this discovery, for somehow
he had calculated on getting out that way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Ned started a systematic round of the cellar. It
was walled with rough stone, against which he
groped in the darkness as he went round it. All
at once, his hands encountered an empty space.
By dint of feeling he could make out that the
wall at that point was built in a U-shape, as if
it had been intended to make a chimney or a fireplace
there.</p>

<p>Hardly had he made this discovery before Ned
found out something else.</p>

<p>This was, that by gazing upward he could feel
a cool breeze in his face. Presently, far above
him he saw the glimmer of stars.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried the boy; “that looks good.
Now, let’s see, I must be at the bottom of a chimney
of some kind. Maybe it has an opening
into one of the rooms of the house above. At any
rate, it may be possible to climb up it&mdash;it’s wide
enough. Here goes for a try, anyhow.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NED IS ASTONISHED.</span></h2>


<p>He felt about, and soon made out that the
chimney was made of rough stone, with rather
wide interstices between each boulder. It was an
easy matter to clamber up it, and soon Ned was
on his way toward the stars framed by the top
of the structure. But when he had reached a
height of some ten feet above the cellar floor,
a strange thing happened. One of his feet struck
a part of the chimney, which gave out a hollow
sound. Moreover, the sound was that of wood.</p>

<p>“Guess that there must be a fireplace opening
there,” thought the Dreadnought Boy; “evidently,
they had it boarded up for the summer, or maybe
the chimney was never finished. Guess that must
be it. Now, the question is, what lies beyond
that board?”</p>

<p>As if in answer to his unspoken thought, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
heard, at that moment, a distinct groan coming
from the other side of the board.</p>

<p>“That must be Mr. Lockyer,” was the boy’s
instant thought; “wonder how tight this board
is?”</p>

<p>A hearty kick soon solved the question. The
board flew outward into the room with a clatter,
and the next instant Ned beheld the face of Channing
Lockyer once more. The inventor was
seated at a table in a room which, apparently,
contained no other furniture beside that and the
chair to which, in a close view, it became apparent
he was tightly bound. In one corner of
the place a lamp, on a high shelf, shed a sickly
light.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lockyer!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>The inventor met his gaze with a half-dazed
look that somehow sent a creepy feeling through
the boy. Crossing the room in a few steps he
shook the other’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lockyer? I’ve come to save you. What
is it? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>A hollow groan was the response, and the inventor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
who had, seemingly, been partially roused
when the chimney-board fell in, let his head sink
forward on the table once more.</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed Ned, with a sudden
remembrance; “I recollect now. Those fellows
did say something about having drugged him.
The stuff seems to be still working. Whatever
will I do? They’ll be back before long, and we
ought to be out of here.”</p>

<p>Reasoning that it would be probably his best
course of action to cut the inventor loose, Ned
drew his knife, of which his captors had not
bothered to deprive him, and slashed the ropes
that bound Channing Lockyer to the chair. As
his bonds relaxed, the inventor slid heavily forward
and sank in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t tough luck,” groaned Ned;
“what am I to do? I can’t carry him far, that’s
certain. Guess I’ll open the door and see if the
fresh air will revive him.”</p>

<p>He swiftly was at the portal. But it would
not yield to his tugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Locked on the outside!” exclaimed Ned; “I’ll
try the window.”</p>

<p>That, too, was locked in some way he could not
discover. But Ned was not one to be beaten by
trifles like that. Picking up the chair, he swung
it against the casement, carrying away sash and
all. The blast of keen sea air that swept in
seemed, to Ned’s delight, to revive Mr. Lockyer.
He stirred like a man awakening from a long
sleep.</p>

<p>“Come, sir, come!” cried Ned, lifting him;
“can’t you stand?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;what has happened?” asked the inventor
thickly. He stared about him with a blank look.</p>

<p>“You’ve been drugged by rascals, but I’m
going to get you out of here,” rejoined Ned;
“come, sir; rouse up. Ah, that’s better,” as the
inventor, with the lad’s aid, got to his feet. He
stood staggeringly, and then Ned, as gently as
he could, half-dragged, half-carried him to the
window.</p>

<p>“Have to lift him through,” thought Ned, as
Mr. Lockyer gazed blankly about him. Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
he had little knowledge of what was
happening.</p>

<p>Putting his strong, young arms about the inventor’s
slight form, Ned lifted him through the
window. Then he followed.</p>

<p>“A fighting chance,” he breathed, as, gathering
up Lockyer in his arms, he began a staggering
run across the heavy sands. Coarse grass
grew upon the island, which bothered him a good
deal, but in the emergency before him, Ned
seemed endowed with superhuman strength.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="437" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“A fighting chance,” he breathed, as, gathering up Lockyer in his
arms, he began a staggering run across the heavy sands.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As one direction seemed as good as another,
he did not pay much heed to where he was going.
Before long he reached the margin of the island.
At least, he could hear the ripple of tiny waves
on the beach.</p>

<p>“Good land,” breathed the lad to himself, setting
down Mr. Lockyer’s limp form, “it will be
child’s play to find us now. If only there were
some way to escape from the island, but I guess
there isn’t, and we’re out of the frying pan into
the fire.”</p>

<p>It was a bitter pill to swallow. To have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
so far and surmounted such obstacles only for
this! For Ned, against all manner of reason,
perhaps, had treasured, deep down in his heart,
a hope that, after all, what he thought an island
might turn out to be a part of the mainland. He
realized that there was no use dwelling in this
fool’s paradise any longer.</p>

<p>As he stood there under the stars, without a
hope left, a sudden sound was borne to his ears.
It was as ominous an interruption to the hush of
the night as could be imagined.</p>

<p>The swift, sharp chug-chug of a motorboat’s
exhaust.</p>

<p>To Ned, it meant only one thing. Ferriss and
his companions were returning. In a few minutes
they would have discovered the escape and
then would scatter and search the island. In that
case, their recapture was inevitable.</p>

<p>“Well, Ned Strong,” said the Dreadnought
Boy half-aloud, “this looks like the beginning of
a particularly lively end.”</p>

<p>But to Ned’s stark astonishment, the next instant
a familiar sound came over the water from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the direction in which the approaching chug-chug
was manifest.</p>

<p>“Jer-us-o-hos-o-phat, shipmates, my advice is
ter cruise back to the submarine. Wherever them
varmints has taken Ned Strong and Mr. Lockyer,
we won’t be able to find ’em. Not to-night,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Which is just where you’re wrong, Tom Marlin!”
hailed Ned, his voice fairly aquiver with
gladness.</p>

<p>“A-h-o-y!” came an amazed hail from the
water. “Ned Strong, my hearty, are you there,
or is it your ghost?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, dear old Tom; but hurry and get
alongside there. Is Herc with you, and young
Sim?”</p>

<p>“Here safe and sound, Ned,” shouted the well-known
voice of the red-headed lad; “thank goodness,
we’ve found you.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Lockyer, too,” shouted back Ned,
in response to the glad shouts that came in a
perfect torrent from the other boat.</p>

<p>“What! How on earth&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind that now. Never mind anything
now but getting that boat in here as close as you
can. They’ll be coming back before long.”</p>

<p>Not stopping to ask who “they” might be, the
boat was run close in to the shore till not more
than a foot of water was between her keel and
the bottom. Then Ned, picking up the still half-dazed
inventor, waded out to her and, presently,
they were safe aboard.</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed the reporter, as Ned swiftly
told his story, “let’s stay here and give those rascals
a fight.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” said Herc wistfully; “maybe we
could arrest them and land them where they belong,
which is in jail.”</p>

<p>But Ned vetoed the proposition. For one
thing, it was important to get Mr. Lockyer back
to where he could have medical attention, for
whatever kind of stuff the rascals had given him,
it seemed to have completely overcome him. He
sat in the bottom of the launch with a vacant look
on his face. The little craft was, accordingly,
put about and headed for Grayport. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
chugged along Herc told how they came to happen
along at such an opportune moment for Ned.</p>

<p>After they had heard the auto speed off, they
had given chase for a while, but had finally desisted
when they saw it was useless. Then they
began to look about for Ned, and discovered that
he was gone. For a time they were at a despairing
standstill, but, after a lot of discussion, it
was agreed to head up the Inlet toward the
islands, as Reporter Hargraves recollected having
heard the ruffians, who had abducted Lockyer,
mention the islands in their talk in the summer
house. They had been cruising around for
some time among the deserted summer colony
of bungalows and islands, and were about ready
to give up the search when they heard Ned’s
hail.</p>

<p>On the way back to Grayport they encountered
something which was to have played an important
part in Ferriss’s plans. This was the drifting
boat in which Gradbarr had rowed Lockyer
ashore. Drifting about, bottom up as she was,
they almost ran her down in the darkness. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
turning her over, they found that Anderson had
carried out his instructions to the letter, for
under one of the thwarts was Mr. Lockyer’s hat.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Herc, with a shudder,
“suppose we had not found you and had encountered
this boat on our way back? We would have
given up Mr. Lockyer for lost for certain, and
your fate would have been a mystery to us.”</p>

<p>No time was lost in reporting on board the
Lockyer, where anxiety and apprehension were
naturally at fever heat. Lieutenant Parry and
Midshipman Stark had returned some hours before,
but they were pacing the deck, on the lookout
for news of some sort, when the launch, with
the returned adventurers, arrived.</p>

<p>Warm, indeed, were the congratulations showered
upon the lads and the reporter, who had
aided them so materially. Mr. Lockyer was
placed in a bunk, and Lieutenant Parry, who had
some knowledge of medicine, administered some
remedies to him. Such good effect did they have
that when a doctor came from the shore in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
morning there was not much for him to do, except
to look profound and recommend rest.</p>

<p>The police were communicated with, and a
force of men sent to the island on which Mr.
Lockyer had been imprisoned. Evidences of a
hasty flight were found there. Evidently, Ferriss
and his companions had returned, and finding
that in some mysterious way their prisoners had
escaped, had not deemed it wise to linger.</p>

<p>The auto had been hired, it was discovered,
from a reputable garage in the town. As for
the bungalow, that had been rented by Ferriss
some days before. He had represented himself
as an invalid anxious to try the fresh-air cure,
and the real estate agent who rented the place
to him had had no suspicion of the real purposes
for which he wanted it. Although a “general
alarm” was sent out for all who had taken part
in the dastardly night’s work, no trace was discovered
of them in Grayport or the vicinity.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve fired their last gun,” commented
Ned, when this information was brought
off to the submarine that evening. But in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the Dreadnought Boy was mistaken. Such men
as Ferriss do not accept defeat kindly. It only
enrages their degraded natures and makes them
hungry for vengeance on those who they deem
have thwarted their ends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TOM’S VERY THICK FOG.</span></h2>


<p>From being a place which had little existence
besides a name on the map, Grayport had suddenly
blossomed out into quite a celebrated spot.
Naturally, Hargraves’s story of the attack on
the submarine experimenters, and the stories of
the other men concerning the interesting tests,
excited a great deal of attention. All sorts of
people began to flock to Grayport. Among them
came several cranks. All day long quite a flotilla
of small boats maneuvered about the submarine
as she lay at anchor, but nobody was allowed
aboard. Even the newspaper correspondents,
after they had been given that first story, were
barred.</p>

<p>For two days following the adventures of the
night of Mr. Lockyer’s abduction, the Lockyer
lay idle at her moorings. But within her steel
shell, things were anything but idle. Incessant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
work was going forward on the engines, getting
them to the highest possible state of efficiency.
The reason for this was, at present, a mystery
to the boys, but it lay in the fact that Lieutenant
Parry’s report had been so favorable that the
Government had decided to send a special board
to Grayport to investigate the little diving vessel.</p>

<p>So it came about, that on the morning of the
third day, when Mr. Lockyer was completely recovered,
and his usual active, nervous self once
more, a trim-looking gunboat steamed into Grayport
harbor, and cast anchor not far from the
little vessel. Lieutenant Parry, calling his crew
together, then made an announcement which
thrilled them all. That evening, in all probability,
they would start on a long trial spin with the
members of the board as passengers. He impressed
them all that he wished the Lockyer to
be put through her best paces. Mr. Lockyer
thanked him with a look for his words. So far,
the submarine had done all that she should, but
the crucial test, under keen, impartial eyes, remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Lieutenant Parry, in a
shore boat, left the Lockyer for the gunboat&mdash;the
Louisville. He was on his way to pay his
respects to Captain McGill, the president of the
testing board, and his brother officers. When
he returned on board again before noon, it was
with the five officers comprising the party of
investigation. All wore their uniforms and
made an imposing array.</p>

<p>The Lockyer, too, with the naval members of
her crew in blue uniform, was decked out like a
fighting ship. From her stern fluttered the Stars
and Stripes. From her forward mooring-bits, to
the last bolt on her keelson plate, she had been
scoured and polished.</p>

<p>“A smart-looking little craft,” commented
Captain McGill, after he had been introduced to
Mr. Lockyer. The inventor colored with pleasure.</p>

<p>“I hope to prove to you, sir, that she is as
smart as she looks,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>The officers now took possession of the cabin,
and the boys and the remainder of the crew were
banished to the engineers’ quarters. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
rather cramped, and Ned was not sorry when it
came to the turn of himself and Herc to take
watch on deck.</p>

<p>They were kept busy enough up there, answering
questions and fending off too-inquisitive
boats, whose occupants were eager to come on
board. After an inspection of the vessel, the
naval party went ashore in the gunboat’s launch
to send some despatches to Washington. This
done, they embarked once more to take council
with Captain McGill on board the Louisville.</p>

<p>This afforded the men left on board more freedom,
and they took turns at coming on deck for
a bit of fresh air. Toward the middle of the afternoon&mdash;to
the boys’ consternation&mdash;a heavy
fog came rolling in. It began to look as if the
distance cruise that night might have to be abandoned.
Old Tom gazed at the wreaths of vapor
as they came drifting in from the Sound, wrapping
the waters about the Lockyer in a white
obscurity.</p>

<p>“If this don’t lift by sundown it’s good for all
night,” he remarked. “Say,” he went on suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
“did I ever tell you lads about the time I
was in a fog in the English Channel on board
the old wind-jammer Wampus?”</p>

<p>The boys shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes for the yarn, then,” said old
Tom. “The Wampus was one of them bluff-bowed
old craft that they used to build by the
mile, and sell by the foot. I was on board her
on a voyage from Brest to Boston. All went
well till we got in the English Channel, when a
thick, pea-soup-kind of a fog shut down on us.
It was so bad that you couldn’t see the forecastle
from the stern.</p>

<p>“It was my trick at the wheel that afternoon,
and for company I had the skipper, an old Maine
Yankee. He was so plum nervous that all he
could do was to pace up and down and cuss the
fog. The English Channel is crowded with shipping,
and every now and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“M-o-o-o-o-o-m! would go some fog horn off
in the smother.</p>

<p>“All to once, we both give a jump. Right dead
ahead of us we heard a fog horn start up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“M-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-m!</p>

<p>“I tell you, it gave me the shivers to hear it.
‘Hard over!’ bawls the skipper, and I spun that
wheel round like a squirrel, I tell you. Well, her
head swung off, but it didn’t seem to be no good.</p>

<p>“M-o-o-o-o-o-o-m! come that sound again, and
it seemed ter be jest ther same place as it was
before.</p>

<p>“‘Confound them, are they tagging us?’ shouts
Captain Wellfleet.</p>

<p>“‘Looks like it, sir,’ says I, swinging her over
and going off on the other tack. But no sooner
was we headed the other way than I’m blessed
if that same old horn didn’t start up again.</p>

<p>“M-o-o-o-o-m!</p>

<p>“‘It’s the Flying Dutchman!’ declares the
skipper, who was one of the old-school, hard-shell
sailormen, and believed in Adamaster and
all them things. By that time, although I didn’t
take much stock in such yarns as that, I began
to think there was something out of the ordinary
in the wind. Well, sir, for half an hour or more
we swung to and fro, and always we’d have that
same old ‘M-o-o-o-o-o-m!’ dead ahead of us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so it kept up till it came time to change
watches. The fog was just as thick as ever, and
we didn’t see my relief coming from for’ard till
he reached the waist. By this time the skipper
was jumping about from one foot to the other,
pretty nearly daffy. And still, every now and
then, we’d hear that ‘M-o-o-o-o-m!’ right off our
bow. It was fairly uncanny, I’m telling you, the
way it chased us.</p>

<p>“‘Send the cook aft, and tell him to make me
a cup of tea,’ roars the skipper, as my relief comes
up. ‘My nerves is knocked plum galley-west.’</p>

<p>“‘Sorry, sir,’ says the man; ‘the cook is doctoring
the cow.’</p>

<p>“‘Doctoring the cow?’ bellows the skipper.</p>

<p>“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ says my mate; ‘she’s ate
suthin’ that disagreed with her an’ she’s got a
tummy-ache. Hark!’</p>

<p>“He held up his finger, and we hears that fog
horn noise again.</p>

<p>“‘M-o-o-o-o-o-m!’</p>

<p>“‘Is that the horn-swoggled cow?’ roars the
skipper, fair beside himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Aye, aye, sir!’ says my mate, touching his
cap; ‘she’s bin’ bellering that way fer an hour
or more.’</p>

<p>“‘Great shades of Neptune!’ yells the skipper,
‘and we’ve bin tagging all over the Channel, trying
ter git away from the beller of our own cow.’</p>

<p>“And that,” concluded old Tom solemnly, “was
the worst fog I was ever in, boys. They do say,
too, that bovine made fine corned beef, and they
used the tin cow&mdash;condensed milk&mdash;for the rest
of that ’ere voyage.”</p>

<p>“Say, Tom, do you expect us to believe that?”
asked Herc, with a wink at Ned, after their
laughter had subsided.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the old man-o’-warsman indignantly.
“If there’s any insulting doubt in
your mind I’ll tell you the year and date of the
month.”</p>

<p>“Ahoy, Lockyer!” came a hail through the fog
at this moment.</p>

<p>“Ahoy!” hailed Ned, “what boat’s that?”</p>

<p>“Lockyer!” came the answer.</p>

<p>Ned knew at once from this, though the fog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hid the boat, that it was Lieutenant Parry and his
party returning.</p>

<p>As commander <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</i> of the submarine, Lieutenant
Parry had answered to Ned’s hail by giving
the boat’s name. This&mdash;under Navy usage&mdash;signified
that he was the captain. Other commissioned
officers would have hailed: “Aye, aye.”
Enlisted men would have replied: “Halloo!”</p>

<p>The short flight of steel steps, which did duty
as an officer’s gangway, was hastily lowered from
the starboard side of the submarine, and the party
received on board in Navy style.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much like a cruise to-night,
Lockyer, I’m afraid.” Ned, standing at attention
by the gangway, heard Lieutenant Parry remark
this to the inventor as they went below.</p>

<p>But good fortune was to favor the submarine
after all. At sundown a brisk breeze sprung up,
before which the fog rapidly melted away. By
dusk the skies were clear, and outside the harbor
a sharp wind was kicking up white-caps in
dancing water-rows. It was ideal weather for
cruising, and when, after supper, the order came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to up anchor, the command was obeyed with
alacrity.</p>

<p>But smart as the Lockyer had been in hastening
to make ready for her start after the fog
had lifted, another boat in the harbor was ahead
of her in getting to sea. This was a largish catboat,
which had come in that morning. Some
time before the order came to “up anchor” on
their own craft, the crew of the Lockyer had
watched the catboat, on which were two men,
slip from her moorings and, heeling gracefully
before the breeze, run out of the harbor. Soon
she was skipping across the Sound, bobbing
about like a dancer in a quadrille. The dying
light glowed goldenly on her big, single sail.</p>

<p>“Those fellows are off for a night’s cruise,
too,” commented Herc, as he watched the white
canvas glimmering more and more dimly in the
gathering dusk.</p>

<p>“Guess they’re reaching off for a run to Bridgeport,”
rejoined Ned. But in this surmise he
came far&mdash;very far&mdash;from guessing the real object
of the catboat’s cruise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SHIPWRECKED MEN&mdash;AND A BOX.</span></h2>


<p>It was an exhilarating experience&mdash;this of racing
through the wind-torn water. As Ned and
Herc, who had been posted on deck-watch, for
so long as the submarine cruised on the surface,
stood in the lee of the conning-tower, muffled up
in their warm reefers, they fairly chuckled with
delight. Urged forward by her three propellers,
the submarine’s form slipped through the tumble
of waters like a swift, gliding thing endowed
with life.</p>

<p>“Wonder when we are going to dive?” said
Ned, as on and on, through the dark, raced the
little craft, her rounded steel sides gleaming wet
with flung spray.</p>

<p>“Hope they don’t forget us when they make
up their minds to go under,” said Herc, with a
grin; “it’s pretty dusty on the water to-night.”</p>

<p>“No danger of our being forgotten,” rejoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Ned, with a laugh. “Wow, but they are speeding
her up. I suppose they want to show that
official outfit of big bugs what she can do.”</p>

<p>This was the case. In the conning-tower,
crowded closely together in that narrow space,
were the naval officers. Their faces fairly shone
as the Lockyer plunged through the heaving
water-rows.</p>

<p>“This craft beats anything we have in the service
up to date!” exclaimed Commander McGill
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“And I think you’ll find she is as capable under
the water as she is on the surface,” put in Mr.
Lockyer, his first apprehensive nervousness now
gone. His boat was behaving magnificently. He
felt that he could ask no more of any bit of machinery.</p>

<p>“Shall we prepare for a dive, sir?” inquired
Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>“Not now, Parry,” rejoined the Navy captain,
glancing at his watch. “I want to keep this up
for at least an hour. It is a severe test&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“But she’ll stand it. You’ll see,” interrupted
Mr. Lockyer eagerly.</p>

<p>On and on rushed the Lockyer, her decks
gleaming wetly as her bow threw back clouds
of spray. The boys on deck were wet through,
but in the exhilaration of the moment they did
not feel it. This sensation of hissing through
the water, fairly in the midst of the rolling
waves, was a blood-stirring one.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ned seized Herc’s arm, and pointed
out ahead.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;look there, Herc!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The other, following the direction of his comrade’s
arm, instantly perceived, not more than
half a mile off, the lights of a boat of some kind.</p>

<p>“They’re coming straight for us,” cried Herc;
“what do they want to do? Run us down?”</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” laughed Ned; “our sailing
lights are on. I guess they’re holding that
tack till it’s time to go about. She’s a sailing
craft of some sort. I can see the black outline
of her sail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few moments more they watched, and
then Herc gave a cry.</p>

<p>“It’s that catboat.”</p>

<p>“What? The one we saw leave Grayport to-night?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Stay here a minute, Herc,” exclaimed Ned;
“I’m going forward to see if our sailing lights
are all right.”</p>

<p>The catboat was only a few hundred feet from
them now, and still she had not altered her course.
Ned slipped forward, through the water that
swirled about on the decks as high as his knees.
The side lights, elevated on iron frames, were
found to be burning brightly and undimmed. His
supposition that they had gone out and that the
catboat had not sighted them was, therefore, untenable.</p>

<p>Hastening back, Ned placed his lips to a speaking-tube
at the side of the tower and shouted in
to the helmsman:</p>

<p>“Catboat off the starboard bow, sir, and making
dead for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” came back the hail from Midshipman
Stark, who had the wheel. “We see her.
Can you make out if she’s going about?”</p>

<p>Ned placed his hands to his mouth funnel-wise
and hailed the oncoming craft.</p>

<p>“Catboat ahoy!”</p>

<p>Then down the wind there came a flung reply:</p>

<p>“Aye, aye. Keep on your course. We’ll tack
directly.”</p>

<p>“They’d better hurry up, then,” thought Ned;
“if they don’t they’ll be into us before you can
say ‘knife.’”</p>

<p>For a brief, nerve-tingling space of time they
kept their eyes glued on the little craft. So near
was she now that they could almost have thrown
any object from the submarine’s deck upon hers.</p>

<p>“See, they’re going to tack!” cried Herc;
“they’re drawing the sheet tight and&mdash;&mdash;They’re
over!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” burst from Ned, as the sailing
craft seemed to leap up into the wind for an
instant, and then, without the slightest warning,
capsized on her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly the top of the conning-tower was
thrown open by those inside who had witnessed
the accident at the same moment.</p>

<p>Life-belts were hastily thrown out, and Ned,
giving a strong heave, hurled one in the direction
of the capsized catboat. Herc did the same.
Both buoys were of the Navy type, carrying a
small receptacle of chemical substances.</p>

<p>The chemicals, when they struck the water,
ignited and burst into a steady blue flame. They
illuminated the water with a ghastly radiance.
In the weird glare those on the submarine could
see two black objects struggling in the water
alongside the catboat. The next instant the castaways
were perceived to crawl out of the water
and climb painfully up on to the keel of the capsized
boat. They clung there, shouting, while
Midshipman Stark maneuvered the Lockyer
alongside.</p>

<p>Save for a few sharp words of command, none
of the Navy party had shown the least trace of
excitement. Trained to accept any emergency
with stiff upper lips, Uncle Sam’s sailors, be they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
officers or men, don’t waste words. But what
they lack in hysterics, they make up in action.
In less time than it takes to tell it, the submarine
was alongside the capsized boat, and Ned and
Herc were reaching out their arms to the two
men on her keel. One of them, they noticed,
clutched a box tightly in his arms.</p>

<p>“Jump,” urged Ned; “we’ll catch you.”</p>

<p>The man with the box made a leap and slipped
flounderingly on the wet steel plates of the diving
vessel’s side. He almost dropped his burden, but
recovered it instantly. The other, however,
seemed in no hurry. He was apparently fumbling
with something at his waist.</p>

<p>“Hanged if he hasn’t got on a life-belt,” exclaimed
Herc, as the first of the survivors was
hurried below.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” exclaimed Ned; “when, on
earth, did he have time to put one on?”</p>

<p>In fact, it did seem impossible, so suddenly
had the catboat capsized, that her occupants
would have had time to strap on the safety devices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Did they then know that she was going to
capsize before she went over?</p>

<p>But Ned had not time to revolve the puzzling
question in his mind. The remaining man now
made a clumsy jump, and almost missed the submarine,
but strong arms caught him, and he was
hauled on board. As he was dragged over the
rail, however, something fell from his pocket
which struck the steel deck with a metallic ring.
It went bounding off, and vanished with a splash.</p>

<p>“A revolver!” gasped Ned; “now, what does
a man, out for a sail in a catboat, want with a
revolver?”</p>

<p>Both the rescued men were hurried below, and
as Lieutenant Parry, who had emerged on deck,
had noted by this time the drenched condition of
Ned and Herc, he ordered them also below to
change their uniforms and put on dry clothing.
They entered one of the small staterooms to do
so. As it happened, it was one adjoining the
room into which the two rescued men had been
ushered by the submarine’s officers for the same
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the staterooms appeared to be separated
by thick, steel bulkheads, as a matter of fact
these partitions were not so solid as they appeared.
At the top of each was a lattice-work
strip, through which air could circulate while
the submarine was under the water. Evidently,
the rescued men were not aware of this, for they
took no care to sink their voices as they talked,
and their conversation was not of a kind, so the
boys judged, anyway, that they would have
wished to blurt out from the housetops.</p>

<p>As the voices came floating through the lattice-work
at the top of the bulkheads, Ned gripped
Herc’s arm to enjoin absolute silence. He did
not, of course, wish to betray, by the slightest
sound, the fact that they were there.</p>

<p>“Well, Ignacio,” came one voice, “the first
part of our task is accomplished. It was easier
than I thought it would have been. For a moment
I almost lost the box. A good thing they
didn’t try to examine it.”</p>

<p>“That is right, Guiseppi,” was the reply;
“these fools on the submarine fell into the trap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
very neatly. However, the hardest part of our
duty lies still before us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the reward makes it well worth the
risk. If we are detected it will be easy to say
that we were ignorant and wished to examine the
machinery. They will never suspect. These
Americans have the heads of wood and the senses
of stone.”</p>

<p>The other laughed aloud, which brought an
angry caution from his friend.</p>

<p>“Not so loud,” he enjoined; “it would not
sound natural for shipwrecked men to be laughing.
Play your part well, Ignacio. We must assume
the sorrowful faces of men who have met
with a serious accident.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear for me, my friend. I can assume
the doleful pose to perfection,” rejoined the other.
“Come, you have your dry clothes on?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am already invested in my American
uniform,” rejoined the other, with a chuckle. “If
they knew what we were on board for do you
think they would treat us with such hospitality?”</p>

<p>“I think they would show us the hospitality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
throwing us overboard, my dear Guiseppi,”
chuckled Ignacio.</p>

<p>The listening boys heard the door open and
close, and the next instant, out in the cabin, they
could hear the two castaways giving a woeful
narration of their disaster to Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>“Signor Captain,” one was saying, “the tiller
jammed so hard that before the poor boat could
come about&mdash;poof!&mdash;the wind had blown her
over and, behold, if it had not been for your extreme
kindness, we would have been drowned.”</p>

<p>“And, in my opinion, that would have been a
fitting fate for the rascals,” muttered Ned, viciously
poking his head into a dry shirt as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Then you have made up your mind that it
was all a trick?” asked Herc. “A plan hatched
up to get a chance to board the Lockyer?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that evident from the way they were
talking?” inquired Ned. “I mean to lose no time
in communicating with Lieutenant Parry; those
fellows will bear watching.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if it is all part of the scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to discredit the Lockyer boats with the Government,”
said Herc.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it strikes me, too. Are you
through changing? Yes&mdash;so am I. Come on,
we’ll get Lieutenant Parry aside and tell him
about it.”</p>

<p>When they emerged into the cabin once more
the two rescued men were seated on a divan, talking
to the naval officer. Ned noticed that they
were both dark, foreign-looking fellows, one of
whom had a particularly sinister face, the evil
expression of which was not relieved by a livid
scar running down one side of his countenance,
from his temple to his chin.</p>

<p>Both looked the very picture of dejection.
Just as miserable and forlorn-appearing as two
men might have been expected to be who had just
lost a valuable boat. The better to act their part,
they were speaking about demanding damages
as the boys came up. Nor had they forgotten to
express a proper amount of surprise at finding
themselves on board a submarine craft.</p>

<p>But, as our readers will suppose, their plight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
created no sympathy in the hearts of Ned and
Herc. In fact, it was all the red-headed lad could
do&mdash;he admitted afterward&mdash;to restrain himself
from jumping on the scarred man and giving him
a sound thrashing.</p>

<p>“Can we speak to you a moment, sir?” asked
Ned, saluting as they came up.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Strong,” said the officer, facing
around and looking rather surprised; “what is
it?”</p>

<p>“Something to do with the machinery, sir.
Can you step this way a minute?”</p>

<p>Seeing by the look in Ned’s eyes that he had
something of importance to communicate, the officer
followed the boys across the cabin and
through the bulkhead door separating it from the
engine room.</p>

<p>“Now, Strong, what is it?” he asked as Ned
carefully closed the door behind them and led the
way to a leather-covered divan, on which the
engineer was wont to sit in the intervals of his
duty. Just now, however, both he and his crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
were busy about the engines, and paid little attention
to the intruders in their realm.</p>

<p>“It’s about those two men, sir.”</p>

<p>“Those two poor Italians, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Poor Italians, nothing&mdash;that is, I beg your
pardon, sir,” burst out Herc; “but if we are not
mistaken, they are two precious rascals who have
the destruction or injury of the submarine in their
black hearts.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the amazed officer; “explain
yourself at once, Taylor.”</p>

<p>But it was Ned who told the story. The red-headed
Herc was too explosive with indignation
to relate it coherently. The officer listened attentively,
but in silence. When Ned had quite finished
he spoke:</p>

<p>“You have been of inestimable service to-night,
boys,” he said; “there is no doubt in my mind,
from what you have told me, that those ruffians
have some scheme in mind. But what can it be?
They cannot hope to harm the engines or any of
the machinery, for it is all closely guarded while
we are cruising.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“It occurred to me, sir,” said Ned soberly,
“that it might be a good idea to get hold of and
examine that box they brought on board. It
didn’t look just natural, sir, for a man, whose boat
has capsized, to have presence of mind enough
to still retain possession of a box in the way those
fellows did.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, my boy,” responded the officer;
“but the question is, how are we going to get a
chance to examine it? We cannot seize these
men by force on the mere suspicion that they are
ruffians&mdash;although I think that fact is pretty
well established. Then, too, any sort of disturbance
on board on this critical night would interfere
with the tests and, perhaps, ruin our friend
Lockyer’s chances to dispose of his boats.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” agreed Ned soberly; “but, sir,
I’ve been thinking of a plan by which we can
get access to the box. Taylor and I have the
graveyard watch at eight bells (midnight). You
will be in charge of the vessel at that hour. Now,
if I give an alarm that the boat is sinking, we
can get those fellows out of their cabin, and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
they are outside, Taylor and I can slip in and
examine that box.”</p>

<p>“A splendid idea, Strong; but how are we to
avoid waking the others?”</p>

<p>“We will only pound on their door, sir. They
will naturally imagine that the others have also
been called.”</p>

<p>“Strong, it seems to me that your plan is a
perfect one. In case there is nothing in the box
we can say that it was a false alarm that roused
us out.”</p>

<p>“And in case there is?” asked Ned solemnly.</p>

<p>“The United States Navy has a way of dealing
with such men,” was the grim reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Parry!” came a hail from the conning-tower
at this moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined the officer, springing to
the foot of the steel ladder, as he recognized Captain
McGill’s voice.</p>

<p>“The hour on the surface is up. Will you
have the necessary orders given for submersion?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” came the brisk response.</p>

<p>Instantly sharp commands rang out through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the submarine. There was a clamor of metal and
a hissing of intake valves as the salt water rushed
into the submersion tanks. In the engine room,
speed was reduced almost to the neutral point as
the diving vessel sank. As her floors slanted
and the downward, forward rush began, the dial
hand on the wall of the cabin began to move.</p>

<p>Ten&mdash;twelve&mdash;twenty&mdash;forty&mdash;fifty&mdash;sixty,
seventy&mdash;one hundred fathoms, and still it crawled
round the gauge.</p>

<p>“We are going lower than we ever have before,”
exclaimed Ned to Herc, as the two met
and passed in the cabin on their way to their different
stations.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” laughed Herc; “I hope we come up
again.”</p>

<p>The two men on the divan exchanged a significant
look.</p>

<p>“You’ll come up again,” muttered the one
called Guiseppi, “but the days of the Lockyer are
numbered, so make the most of her while she
lasts.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN INFERNAL MACHINE.</span></h2>


<p>“What depth, Mr. Stark?”</p>

<p>Captain McGill, standing by the side of the
young middy, asked the question. They were still
running under water, but the air, which had just
been changed, was as fresh as if they were on
the surface. A heavy vibration was noticeable
though as the powerful engines forced the cigar-shaped
craft through the tremendous pressure of
the lower waters.</p>

<p>“Hundred fathoms, sir,” was the rejoinder.
The naval officer glanced at his watch. Then
his eyes fell on the distance recorder.</p>

<p>“We’ve run forty miles at that depth,” he said,
“but keep her submerged. This was to be a
thorough test.”</p>

<p>“She’s having it, sir,” ventured the midshipman;
“we must be out of the Sound and under
the Atlantic by this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we left Block Island some miles to our
stern quite a little while ago,” was the reply.
“It’s a queer thing to think that there may be
some big liner’s keel right above us at this moment.”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, sir,” agreed Mr. Stark. Just
then, Mr. Lockyer and Lieutenant Parry, with
other members of the testing party who had
been below examining the engines, entered the
conning-tower. They reported everything as
working to the pitch of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lockyer, I congratulate you, sir,”
said Captain McGill ponderously. “I think that
your craft will prove a magnificent success.
There is only one thing now to test her at, and
that is to ascertain how she stands the vibrations
set up by torpedo firing.”</p>

<p>“If we could run across a derelict&mdash;&mdash;,” began
Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, young man, I hope we do no
such thing,” laughingly exclaimed Captain McGill;
“at this depth, and at ten miles an hour, we
would never reach the surface to tell the tale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
However, that does not prevent me from admitting
that I’m exceedingly sleepy. Gentlemen,
it is almost eight bells. Suppose we turn in for
a nap. We can be called if anything occurs.”</p>

<p>“This traveling under water seems to affect
one’s wakefulness,” yawned one of the board.
“I think your suggestion is an excellent one,
captain.”</p>

<p>Soon afterward, leaving orders to be summoned
at once if anything out of the way occurred,
the officers composing the board retired
to their staterooms. Quarters were close on the
Lockyer, but room had been found for all. The
two apparent castaways had gone to their stateroom
some time before.</p>

<p>“Ding-ding! Ding-ding! Ding-ding! Ding-ding!”</p>

<p>The ship’s bell clock sounded out eight bells.
Ned and Herc, on watch in the conning-tower,
exchanged significant glances. Midshipman
Stark was at the wheel, but knowing nothing of
the plans on foot, the chiming of the hour meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
nothing to him, but that the night was slipping
by extremely slowly.</p>

<p>As the last strokes of the bell died away, a hail
of “all’s well” came from the engine room.</p>

<p>It was echoed from the conning-tower, where
the boys stood with beating hearts. The hour
that was to witness their ruse had struck. Presently
Lieutenant Parry’s foot sounded on the
rounds of the steel ladder.</p>

<p>“Strong and Taylor, come below,” he ordered,
in a sharp voice. His tones were low, however.</p>

<p>Both boys instantly obeyed. Their hearts beat
a little faster than usual as they descended into
the cabin. They were about to attempt a somewhat
risky bit of business. Both the supposed
plotters were desperate-looking men, and the conversation
the lads had overheard did not lead
them to suppose that the additions to the Lockyer’s
company were any less bad than they
looked.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll go to the door,” said the officer, as
the two young blue-jackets faced him, “and give
the alarm. Then you leave the rest to me, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the instant the cabin is empty, you dive in there
and examine the box.”</p>

<p>The boys nodded.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” they said, as if they had received
a routine order of some sort.</p>

<p>The officer crossed the cabin floor in a couple
of strides. Going to the door of the two Italians,
he turned the handle. It was unlocked. Fortune
favored him then. He could arouse them
without awakening anyone else. But as he
opened the door a strange thing happened. One
of the men sprang suddenly upright and, for an
instant, seemed to be about to spring at the officer’s
throat. The next instant he subsided with
a low laugh.</p>

<p>“Pardon, sir; I&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” burst out Lieutenant Parry,
in an excited voice, which was excellently assumed;
“never mind that now. Get up! Quick!
The submarine is in peril!”</p>

<p>“In peril! Santa Maria!”</p>

<p>The fellow sprang from his bunk. It could
then be seen that he was fully dressed. His companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
also, must have been feigning sleep, for
he, too, was up in an instant. He, likewise, was
fully dressed.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, we are in danger?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“The greatest. Come quick!”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parry seized both the men in an
iron grasp and rushed them out of the cabin.
He was afraid if they lingered they might stop
to pick up the box.</p>

<p>“This way! This way! Quick! Pray heaven
we are not too late!” he cried, as he hustled them
through the engine-room door, closing it behind
them with a loud clang.</p>

<p>“<em>Now!</em>” exclaimed Ned, “we’ve not a minute
to lose.”</p>

<p>Followed by Herc, he darted forward like a
hound that has just picked up a hot scent.</p>

<p>Another instant and they were in the cabin
lately occupied by the two Italians. Ned thrust
an arm under the lower bunk. As he had expected,
the box was there&mdash;a stout, black receptacle,
bound at the corners with brass.</p>

<p>It had a lock on, but drawing his marlin-spike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
knife, Ned had it burst open in an instant. As
he broke the lock there was a loud snap and a
queer sound like the ticking of a loud clock was
heard.</p>

<p>Tick-tock! Tick-tock!</p>

<p>Ned threw back the lid, and as the contents
of the box lay before him, he gave a gasp. At
first sight the interior of the thing looked not
unlike the works of a clock. It was this machinery
that was ticking. In one corner was a tiny
hammer, raised above what seemed to be a percussion
cap. Below this cap was a thick, gelatinous-looking
stuff. As he saw this latter, Ned
gave a cry, and thrusting his hand into the box,
tore the machinery out of it and hurled it clean
across the cabin.</p>

<p>“An infernal machine!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“What!” almost screamed Herc.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see,” shouted Ned excitedly; “this
yellow stuff is nitro-glycerine. Enough to blow
this boat to pieces. That clockwork, when set
going, would, in due time, bring the hammer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
down on the percussion cap, touching off the diabolical
affair, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before he could utter another word something
sprang on him, encircling his neck, ape-like, with
long arms. Ned saw a bright thing flash above
him. Instinctively, he knew that it was a knife.
Swiftly he threw up one arm and caught the descending
blade in the nick of time. At the same
instant, a scream of baffled rage rang out, as
strong arms seized Guiseppi, who had sprung
upon him, and dragged him off the Dreadnought
Boy’s back.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the engine room Ignacio
struggled, foaming and blaspheming, in Engineer
Bowler’s grip, but the husky ex-foreman
held him fast.</p>

<p>“Don’t squirm too lively, you bloomin’ dago,”
he muttered, “or I might get nervous and tap
you on the head with a wrench.”</p>

<p>Held tightly by Lieutenant Parry and two
members of the engine-room crew, Guiseppi, who
had made the murderous attempt on Ned, writhed
and flung himself about with equal vehemence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had hardly gotten them into the engine
room,” explained the young officer, giving the
recalcitrant Guiseppi’s arm a twist, “before they
discovered it was all a trick. I suppose they
knew, in a flash, the object of it, for before I
could stop him, this ruffian here had darted
through the door and sprang upon your back.”</p>

<p>“You were just in time, sir,” said Ned; “I
could hear that knife whistle as he plunged it
down. He fairly had me in chancery, too.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you were just in time, too, Ned,” said
the young officer warmly.</p>

<p>He shuddered as he spoke. But now stateroom
doors began to fly open, and heads were poked
out. Presently, the entire naval board was hearing
the story, while Midshipman Stark, at the
wheel, strained his ears to hear what he could
of it. For he had heard the disturbance, but, of
course, could not leave his post. It was his duty
to stick at the wheel, even if he had known that
the submarine was about to be blown up.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Captain McGill, when
he had heard Lieutenant Parry’s story, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
these two lads are entitled to a great deal of
credit for the part they played in this affair.
They not only acted bravely, but with discretion,
which is better than mere courage. You, too,
Parry, did a clever thing. I think, gentlemen,
that all three are to be congratulated for securing
a pair of precious scoundrels.”</p>

<p>The two Italians were then, at Captain McGill’s
orders, triced up to stanchions. Bound securely,
they glowered at their captors furiously,
but for some time refused to speak. At last, Ignacio,
in response to Captain McGill’s questioning,
confessed the whole plot.</p>

<p>They had been hired by Ferriss and Camberly&mdash;whose
shipyard they had formerly worked in&mdash;to
carry out the daring plan to wreck the
Lockyer. Knowing that they could not get on
board by any ordinary means, they had chartered
the catboat and purposely capsized her, so
that they would have to be taken on board. Their
plan had then been to wait till she was in port
and then set the machine among her engines,
wrecking them hopelessly. Both men denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that they had intended to take any lives. But,
in view of the amount of nitro-glycerine contained
in their machine, it was practically certain
that anyone who had the misfortune to be on
board at the time it exploded, would have been,
if not killed, seriously injured.</p>

<p>As soon as this confession had been extorted
from the men it was set down in writing, and
they were compelled to sign it. The submarine
was then headed for the surface, and the nitro-glycerine
gingerly carried on deck and dumped
overboard.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to be shipmates with the stuff
in that form many minutes longer than I have
to be,” said Captain McGill, amid a general
laugh, in which, perhaps, there was a little of
the trace of the nervous strain which they had
undergone.</p>

<p>At Mr. Lockyer’s request, the two Italians were
questioned as to the whereabouts of Ferriss and
Camberly, but they professed ignorance of where
their employers were to be found. They were to
have recovered their money by mail, they declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
but as a considerable sum was found on
them, it was always supposed that they received
some of their pay for their rascally attempt in
advance.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” announced Captain McGill,
a short time later, “the tests, both on the
surface, semi-submerged, and submerged, have
been perfectly satisfactory. Let us now head
about and give these rascals over to justice. If
their purpose was to ruin the Lockyer submarine
and prevent her sale to the Government, they
have failed. I shall report her at Washington
as an unqualified success.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir!” said the inventor simply,
and would have added more, but at this instant
there came a sudden sharp hail from Tom Marlin,
who had succeeded Midshipman Stark at the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Something dead ahead, sir. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before he could complete the sentence there
came a terrific shock. The submarine quivered
from stem to stern under the stress of the blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
The party had to clutch at handrails and projections
to avoid being thrown flat.</p>

<p>“We’ve struck something!” shouted Mr. Lockyer.
A terrible fear burned in his eyes as a wild
confusion of shouts and cries arose from below.</p>

<p>The submarine slewed round drunkenly, and a
rasping sound rang from her steel plates. The
inventor, cool-headed despite his alarm for his
craft, sprang to the engine controls. Rapidly,
he spun the telegraph indicator.</p>

<p>“Back! Full speed astern!”</p>

<p>Again came that bumping, rasping sensation.
It was as if the little vessel had struck a reef or
a submerged rock, although the chart showed
none in that part of the ocean.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE GRIM VISAGE OF DANGER.</span></h2>


<p>Lieutenant Parry sprang toward the speaking
tube connecting with the engine room. Already
they could feel the tremor as the submarine was
violently backed from whatever it was she had
struck.</p>

<p>“Stand by your wheel,” he flung at old Tom,
as he jumped.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” was the steady reply. The
weather-beaten old mariner’s face might have
been a mask carved out of mahogany for all the
emotion it displayed.</p>

<p>“Below at the engines!” bawled Lieutenant
Parry down the tube.</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” came up the steady rejoinder from
Bowler, and the officer rejoiced to note that his
voice did not tremble or falter.</p>

<p>“Have we struck something, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Stand by for signals,” snapped the officer,
dropping the tube.</p>

<p>It was typical of the spirit of the Navy, that
after the first shock of amazement at the utterly
unexpected, not a man on board who wore the
uniform betrayed any signs of excitement. The
officers gave quick commands. The men obeyed
them without a word. But the two bound Italians
poured out a flood of lamentations and cries.</p>

<p>“Go below and shut those fellows up!” ordered
Captain McGill sharply.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” responded Herc, with alacrity,
dropping below.</p>

<p>Going up to Guiseppi, the red-headed lad flourished
his fist under his nose.</p>

<p>“Do you want this to collide with your yellow
features?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No, no, signor,” wailed the wretch; “but what
has happened? Are we going to drown? Oh,
Santa Maria! tell us, for the mercy of heaven!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen, except
that if you don’t shut up you’ll get busted
on the nose,” grunted Herc; “you’ll spend a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
years in jail, anyhow, so I don’t see what it
matters to you.”</p>

<p>His threats proved effectual, coupled with his
fierce looks, and the panic-stricken cowards subsided
into whimperings and whinings like the
lamentations of whipped curs. This duty attended
to, Herc sprang up the ladder again, alert
for orders.</p>

<p>“It’s a derelict, sir,” Ned was saying, as the
Dreadnought Boy regained the conning-tower.
“I can make out her masts and the outline of her
hull.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” approved Captain McGill;
“you have sharp eyes, my lad. It is a derelict.”</p>

<p>“The question is, how badly are we damaged?”
put in one of the naval officers. He spoke in
quiet, level tones, though there was not a man
in that conning-tower who did not realize that if
any plates were badly sprung they were in deadly
peril. The Lockyer was at least thirty miles off
shore, and submarines carry no boats!</p>

<p>“Better make an investigation, sir,” suggested
Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“By all means, Mr. Parry. Send forward to
ascertain if any of the forward plates are
sprung.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” exclaimed the officer to himself; “if
they are, down we go to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Here, Strong,” he went on aloud, “you and
Taylor take a lantern. Make thorough examination
of the peak. If you find anything wrong,
report at once.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” cried the boys, and together
they vanished.</p>

<p>Procuring a lantern from the engine room,
they hastened forward on their errand.</p>

<p>“Is she badly damaged?” asked Bowler, as
they left his domain.</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet, old man,” flung back Ned;
“we’re going to see.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she is we’re on the job,” snapped
Bowler, a determined look settling over his face.
It would have gone hard with one of his crew
who showed a sign of flinching in that dread
moment, but his assistants were going about their
tasks, oiling and feeling bearings, without a sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
but their intense pallor to show the strain under
which they were laboring.</p>

<p>“Good thing we don’t carry a crew of them
fellows,” muttered Bowler, as he glanced disgustedly
at the whining, terrified Italians, bound
fast to their stanchions in the cabin.</p>

<p>Through the forward bulkhead the boys hastened.
They found the torpedo room in darkness.
This looked bad, for the incandescents in there
were supposed to be kept burning constantly.</p>

<p>“Guess a wire has snapped,” surmised Ned;
“that shows that we bumped that old derelict
good and hard.”</p>

<p>The walls of the place were beaded with moisture,
condensed from the warmth within the hull
and the chill of the waters without, but there
was no sign of a leak. The floor was removable
for such emergencies, and the lads soon had it
torn up. Hither and thither Ned waved his
lantern over the plates, but seemingly, they were
all tight. All at once, Herc gave a startled cry.
He pointed to a place where a tiny stream of
water could be seen making its way through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“So far as I can see, that’s the only leak,” said
Ned; “the pumps can easily take care of that.”</p>

<p>Further examination confirmed this diagnosis.
That tiny leak was all the damage the submarine
had sustained.</p>

<p>Ned hastened to the conning-tower and so reported.
Immense relief was visible on the countenances
of all as he told of the results of his
investigation.</p>

<p>“Well, a miss is as good as a mile,” said Captain
McGill cheerily; “and we won’t go to Davy
Jones this cruise.”</p>

<p>“I assume your pumps can take care of the
leak, Mr. Lockyer?” asked one of the board.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the inventor; “the boat is
so constructed that all leakage is drained to a
central well. I’ll pass word to the engine room
to have the centrifugal pump set to work at
once.”</p>

<p>“Possibly we can caulk the leak temporarily,”
suggested Lieutenant Parry; “at any rate,
there’s no harm in trying.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Parry,” assented Captain McGill;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“you and Mr. Lockyer go below. Make a
thorough examination, and act according to your
judgment.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” rejoined the young officer, saluting,
and darting off on his errand, followed
by Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>The submarine had been stopped by this time,
and she now lay tossing on the surface of the
waters, her engines silent and motionless, except
for the hum of the dynamos. This latter
sound suggested an idea to Captain McGill.</p>

<p>“Strong, do you understand the management
of this craft’s searchlight?” he inquired, turning
to Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined Ned; “we learned how to
work it as part of our duty before the Lockyer
was launched.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s have some light on this obscure
subject,” said the officer. “I’m anxious to see
what it was that came so near to sending us to
the bottom.”</p>

<p>Ned reached up and loosened an attachment
at the top of the conning-tower. Instantly, raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
by strong springs, the searchlight, which differed
in pattern from the ordinary kind, sprang out
above the lookout place.</p>

<p>Then the Dreadnought Boy pressed a button.
There was a sharp click and a dazzling, white
pencil of radiance swept the dark ocean on which
the Lockyer was rolling. Peering through the
lenses, and shading his eyes with one hand while
he worked a small wheel with the other, Ned
swept the ray about till it suddenly fell on an
object about two hundred yards away from them.</p>

<p>“There, sir, there she is,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The officers peered through the glass ports of
the conning-tower. They saw the brilliantly illuminated
outlines of a large, water-logged
craft, almost level with the water. From her
decks three forlorn stumps of masts stood up as
if in mute appeal. She was as sorry a looking
derelict as one would wish to see. The winds
and the waves had had their way with her and
left only this battered hulk to drift about the
ocean&mdash;a menace to navigation of the most dangerous
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“How long has she been adrift, Barnes, do
you think?” asked Captain McGill, turning to an
officer who stood beside him.</p>

<p>“Hard to say,” rejoined the other; “perhaps
for years. We collided with a junk once off the
Pacific Coast. It had drifted clear across from
China, and from papers found on her, it must
have taken her fifteen years to do it.”</p>

<p>“I guess we have all had our experience with
derelicts,” was the rejoinder; “they are the most
dangerous things a seaman has to encounter.”</p>

<p>“Especially when they are awash, like this
hulk,” was Captain Barnes’s reply.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Parry and Mr. Lockyer returned
at this point to report that an attempt would be
made to caulk the leak temporarily till permanent
repairs could be made. For the present, the pump
would take care of the leakage.</p>

<p>The derelict, irradiated by the bright rays of
the searchlight, was pointed out to the two investigators.
They regarded it with interest, not
unmixed with graver feelings. A little harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
bump against those water-logged sides and what
tragedy of the ocean might not have resulted?</p>

<p>“Confound you!” exclaimed Mr. Lockyer impulsively,
shaking his fist at the sinister object,
as it heaved and rolled in a heavy, sodden way.
“You came near to putting us out of commission.
I’d like to send you to the bottom, where you
belong.”</p>

<p>“Come, Lockyer,” laughed Captain McGill;
“instead of feeling revengeful, you ought to
offer a vote of thanks. This derelict has not
only shown to us that your boat is as staunch
and tough as she is swift and handy, but she is
going to give us another opportunity we were
wishing for.”</p>

<p>“What is that, sir?” asked Lockyer, though he
half-guessed the other’s meaning.</p>

<p>“Why,” responded the naval officer, “fate or
luck, or whatever you like to call it, has thrown
this derelict in our path. She is a serious menace
to navigation. A less fortunate ship might strike
her and be sent to the bottom. By the time a
regular derelict destroyer could be notified, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
might have drifted off out of ken. Now, however,
we have a chance to rid the ocean of her
forever.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;,” began Mr. Lockyer.</p>

<p>“That you carry torpedoes, Lockyer, and we
were wishing an opportunity to test them. Here
is a chance ready to our hands. What do you
think of it?”</p>

<p>“That it would be a magnificent revenge, sir,”
was the prompt rejoinder.</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter and approval went up
from the other officers. After a hasty consultation,
it was agreed to gauge the distance and
depth of the derelict, and then, withdrawing to
a distance of four hundred yards, launch one of
the Lockyer’s deadly implements at her. The
boys’ eyes fairly shone with excitement, as they
heard this. Torpedo work was very much to
their liking.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parry, you will take Boatswain’s Mates
Strong and Taylor, and Bos’un Marlin, and attend
to the torpedo launching. Mr. Stark, you
will take the wheel. I will give you the signal
when to fire, Mr. Parry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain McGill gave a nod to show that his
orders had been issued.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Parry, the boys and old Tom
vanished, he gave a sharp order.</p>

<p>“Astern, Mr. Stark.”</p>

<p>The submarine began to glide backward once
more.</p>

<p>“Stop her. Now, Mr. Lockyer, keep the
searchlight on her while I get the range.”</p>

<p>With a range-finding instrument the range
was soon gauged.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Stark, you will drop to a depth of
ten feet, if you please. I think that will be
about her draught?” asked Captain McGill, turning
to the other officers. They nodded. In backing
from the derelict, a careful line had been kept,
so that as she dropped, her nose was trained
directly amidships on the peril of the seas. Before
the submersion began, of course, the searchlight
had been drawn in.</p>

<p>“Like the horns of a snail,” was the way one
of the onlookers expressed it afterward.</p>

<p>In the meantime, down in the torpedo room,
some active work had been going on. By lantern-light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for her electric connections had not yet
been repaired, the boys and Tom Marlin, under
Lieutenant Parry’s direction, had slid one of the
big, heavy, fourteen-foot Whiteheads from its
shelf into a sort of conveyor. This carried it to
the firing tube, the inner end of which the officer
already had swung open.</p>

<p>“Ram home!” he ordered. The great, cigar-shaped
projectile, with its tiny, fairy-like propellers
and bright metal work gleaming wickedly,
was slid into the tube. With a sharp click and
snap the water-tight breach of the tube was at
once closed. The torpedo was ready for firing.</p>

<p>Before ramming home, however, the “war
head” had been placed in the implement. This
means that the dummy-head had been removed
and one charged with gun-cotton had been substituted
for it. Vessels at sea do not carry war
heads on their torpedoes. It would be too dangerous.
The cap, full of disaster-wreaking explosive,
is not put in place till they are to be
used.</p>

<p>This done, Lieutenant Parry stood by the inner
end of the tube, his hand on a lever. When this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was pulled, it would admit compressed air to the
tube, which would simultaneously open the outer
end of the contrivance and launch the torpedo.
At the same time the pressure would keep the
water out of the tube. The boys knew that in the
Lockyer type of boat, besides the compressed air,
the torpedo was helped on its way by a charge of
the explosive gas being touched off behind it.
This was effected by the compressed air, on its
being turned on, operating a small firing point,
which sparked and instantly exploded the volatile
stuff.</p>

<p>On the top of the torpedo was a small knob.
As the torpedo was shot out of the tube, much as
a bullet is shot from a rifle, this knob struck
another projection on the inside of the tube. This
set in motion the compressed-air engines within
the torpedo, by which it was driven. At the
same time it ignited an alcohol flame which superheated
the compressed air, giving it added force.</p>

<p>With all in readiness, they waited breathlessly
for the signal to come from above. Lieutenant
Parry’s foot tapped nervously, as they stood in
silence. His eyes were fixed on a small incandescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
bulb, wired directly from the conning-tower.
It would flash red when all was ready for him
to pull the lever and release the instrument of
destruction.</p>

<p>“We’re sinking, sir,” said Ned presently.</p>

<p>The officer merely nodded. The moment was
a tense one. There is something to fire the dullest
imagination in the idea, that by a mere twist
of a wrist, one is presently to launch forth one
of man’s most effective engines of devastation.</p>

<p>Only the loud swishing of the water as it
rushed into the tanks broke the silence now. All
at once, the downward motion&mdash;like the falling
sensation of a slow elevator, ceased.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the officer’s head, there was a
tiny, crimson flash.</p>

<p>It was the signal he had been waiting for.</p>

<p>Instantly his hand gave a backward jerk.</p>

<p>They could feel a slight jar as the torpedo,
loaded with two hundred pounds of explosive,
tore from the submarine on her errand of
destruction.</p>

<p>Would she hit the mark?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MUTINY ON THE HIGH SEAS.</span></h2>


<p>That question was soon answered when they
reached the surface, and you may be sure that no time
was lost in carrying out this maneuver. As the searchlight
was sprung into place, on the top of the dripping
conning-tower, its rays swept the sea for yards around.
But of the derelict, that had recently floated, there was
not a trace to be seen. Only some few timbers and a
splintered plank or two were left to mark her passing.</p>

<p>“Wow!” whispered Herc, under his breath, to Ned;
“it’s kind of spooky, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” laughed the other Dreadnought
Boy; “but it’s mighty effective. If this had
been war, and that had been a foreign vessel, we’d
have blown her up in just that way.”</p>

<p>“I hope we get a chance to some day,” exclaimed
Herc.</p>

<p>But Ned’s voice was very sober as he rejoined seriously:</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty serious thing, Herc, to talk about
jokingly. Hundreds of human beings would have gone
to their reckoning if that vessel had been a warship.
That’s something to think over, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The Lockyer cruised about among the wreckage
awhile longer so that the officers might judge for themselves
just what had been the result of the torpedoing.
All agreed that it was as effective a bit of work as
they had ever seen done. It being decided then that
the submarine had been put through about as severe a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
series of tests as could be imagined, the order was
given to put about and head back to Grayport.</p>

<p>The searchlight was extinguished, and the engines
speeded up to twenty knots. Rushing along the surface,
the Lockyer rapidly ate up the miles between
herself and home. As she swept along, Mr. Lockyer’s
face was all aglow. In a quiet aside, Captain McGill
had told him something concerning the report he was
going to make to the Government. Whatever that
something was, it had caused the inventor’s eyes to
fill with something else than gladness, as he seized Captain
McGill’s hand, and exclaimed in a voice that quivered:</p>

<p>“I’ve worked and waited for this many weary days,
sir. It’s the proudest moment of my life.”</p>

<p>Somehow it seemed fitting, too, that the inventor’s
hopes and ambitions should come to their fruition out
on the lonely sea, on board a craft being driven at racing
speed by engines of his construction and design.</p>

<p>Block Island had been left off to starboard, and the
choppy waters of the Sound were beginning to boil
about them, when there came a hail from Midshipman
Stark at the wheel.</p>

<p>“I can see the lights of a craft of some kind ahead,
sir,” he reported, turning to Lieutenant Parry.</p>

<p>“What is she?” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Can’t make out, sir. I&mdash;Jove, there goes a rocket.
She’s in distress of some kind!”</p>

<p>“That rocket was a distress signal, sure enough,”
rejoined Mr. Parry; “hand me those glasses, will you,
Stark?”</p>

<p>Holding the wheel with one hand, the middy did as
he was requested. Then his scrutiny returned to the
lights of the distant vessel. As he gazed, another
rocket soared up and spattered yellowy on the night&mdash;like
an egg shattered against a blackboard.</p>

<p>“She’s a big, white yacht, as nearly as I can make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
out,” said the lieutenant, after he had centered the
glasses on the distant craft.</p>

<p>“Shall I head for her, sir?”</p>

<p>“By all means. Keep her on that course while I go
below and consult Captain McGill.”</p>

<p>The officer soon appeared in the conning-tower, with
the other naval dignitaries. Captain McGill now took
his turn at scrutinizing the yacht through the night
glasses.</p>

<p>He set them down with an exclamation. The submarine
was not more than a few hundred yards from
the yacht now.</p>

<p>“Mutiny on board, by Jove!” exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p>“Mutiny, sir?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Parry! We must lay alongside. I can
see an old gentleman and a girl on the stern deck.
They seem to have been driven there, for the crew are
lined up at the break in the deck, and appear to be
threatening them.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott,” cried one of the other officers. “Mutiny
on the high seas! It’s our clear duty to quell the
disturbance and capture the rascals.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Conover, and we’re going to do it,”
spoke up Captain McGill. “Mr. Lockyer, will you
manage the searchlight, please? Mr. Parry, please
pass the word below for your capable young men.
Send them on deck, and tell them to station themselves
there waiting orders.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“This certainly is the eventful night,” exclaimed
Ned, as he and Herc, with old Tom close behind,
emerged on deck and saw what was going forward.</p>

<p>“It looks like a big night to-night,” hummed Herc
blithely. The prospect of a fight was always a delight
to the red-headed youth, and things certainly seemed
to be “freezing up for one,” as old Tom put it.</p>

<p>Inside the conning-tower, excitement ran at high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
tension now. As they drew near and the white pencil
of the searchlight shot out, bathing the yacht in its
white brilliancy, the vessel began to slip through the
water.</p>

<p>“Ha! Those scoundrels are trying to slip away, but
they don’t know what they’re up against,” said Captain
McGill, his lips compressing grimly. “More speed,
please, Mr. Stark.”</p>

<p>The middy’s hand shot out and touched the telegraph
lever. Instantly, down in the engine room,
cranks began to revolve faster. A quiver ran through
the Lockyer as, like an unleashed greyhound, she
leaped forward.</p>

<p>But as they neared the yacht, overhauling her in
leaps and bounds, it began to look as if they might be
too late. The old gentleman was seen to raise a pistol
and fire. At the same instant a sharp, crackling volley
burst from the mutineers. They saw the girl, who
wore a white yachting suit, turn despairingly, her face
set toward the oncoming submarine, as if in mute
appeal. As the searchlight bathed her features, Lockyer
gave a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! It’s Miss Pangloss and her
father!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Steady on, Lockyer!” whispered Parry, placing
his arms about the inventor. “We’ll be alongside in
a minute, old man.”</p>

<p>“Heaven grant we may not be too late,” breathed
the inventor. In the darkness of the conning-tower
he shook like a leaf. But his gaze never left the intense
scene on the after deck of the yacht. Its details
shone up in the searchlight’s radiance as if it had been
a picture on a lighted stage.</p>

<p>“Give them a hail, Parry,” ordered Captain McGill,
as the submarine crept in alongside the moving yacht.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, on the yacht!” came the lieutenant’s voice;
“heave to immediately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“You go to blazes!” shouted a bloated-faced fellow,
leaning over the rail, and shaking his fist menacingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, get out if you know what’s good for you buttinskis,”
roared another man, joining the first.</p>

<p>“This is a fair warning, men,” exclaimed Lieutenant
Parry. “This vessel is a naval craft. If&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off! That’s no naval craft. Where’s
your pretty uniform?” jeered the mutineers. Then,
from the bloated-faced man came a sharp order.</p>

<p>“If those fellows try to board us, fill them full of
lead.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if we’ve tackled a tougher proposition
than we thought, sir,” said Lieutenant Parry, addressing
Captain McGill, whose head now projected above
the open top of the conning-tower.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, gentlemen, whoever you are,
lay alongside,” appealed the elderly man, whom, it
could now be seen by all who knew him, was, indeed,
Mr. Pangloss. The apostle of peace seemed transfigured,
however. His eyes blazed, and his white hair
stood out like a mane. In his hand he held a revolver.
It was doubtless this weapon that had so far held the
mutineers back.</p>

<p>“Blow the rascals to the sky!” he shouted angrily,
shaking his fist at them menacingly.</p>

<p>As for the girl, she stood erect and apparently fearless.
Channing Lockyer’s eyes dwelt admiringly on
her brave, defiant form. But the old man’s words
proved a reminder to the mutineers that they were
neglecting their mission of loot and plunder. With a
yell, they charged aft as he shouted his defiance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MR. LOCKYER CAPTURES A PRIZE.</span></h2>


<p>But a sharp voice rang out from the deck of the
submarine.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are!”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it now, Mister Bluff?” shouted the
bloated-faced man.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out how much of a bluff we are,”
snapped the officer. “Strong, pass the word below to
load the torpedo tube.”</p>

<p>Ned, carrying out what he guessed was a cleverly
thought-up plan to rout the mutineers, sprang to the
side of the conning-tower.</p>

<p>“Below there!” he hailed. Then he paused, as if
listening for a reply. “Stand by to load the torpedo
tube. Hold your fire till you get the word.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” roared up Midshipman Stark, from his
station at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Now then, sir,” cried Parry, hailing the old man,
“you and the lady buckle on life preservers and jump
overboard. We’ll pick you up.”</p>

<p>“W-w-w-what are you going to do, sir?” quavered
the apostle of peace.</p>

<p>“Blow that vessel and those mutineers sky high!”
exclaimed the young officer.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cheered Ned, Herc and Tom, in ferocious
voices.</p>

<p>The mutineers began to waver. The submarine
folks could see the bloated-faced man trying to rally
them, but he failed. A dozen of them rushed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
rail. Their faces shone ghastly white in the searchlight.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, don’t fire, sir!” they begged.</p>

<p>“We’ll surrender!” shouted another, waving a white
dish-rag.</p>

<p>“Then throw your arms overboard!”</p>

<p>A succession of splashes followed. The mutineers
couldn’t seem to get rid of them fast enough.</p>

<p>“Stand by to catch a line,” then roared the officer;
“we’re coming alongside.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” called back the cowed mutineers, as
the submarine crept up to the yacht’s side. An instant
later she was fast, and her officers and crew were on
the yacht’s deck. Channing Lockyer at once made aft,
followed by most of the officers. The latter were
naturally anxious to ascertain the cause of the trouble.
The inventor was drawn by a different motive&mdash;one
we can guess.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the mutineers were driven forward
and imprisoned in the forecastle. This done, Lieutenant
Parry and the boys were making for the stern
of the vessel, when Ned’s keen eyes noticed the canvas
cover over one of the yacht’s boats shake and quiver
as if something alive were under it.</p>

<p>Darting forward, he pulled it back and beheld, snuggled
down among the thwarts of the boat, two human
figures.</p>

<p>“Two more of them here, sir!” he cried.</p>

<p>The officer and Ned’s mates were at his side in an
instant. In spite of the crouching fellows’ kicks and
protests, they soon had them hauled out and on the
decks. They tried to hide their faces, but they were
remorselessly switched round and made to face the
light.</p>

<p>“Tom Gradbarr!” exclaimed Ned, recognizing his
captive.</p>

<p>“Zeb Anderson, by the big snapping turtle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
South Pole!” yelled Herc, as he made a similar discovery
that his prisoner was not unknown to him.</p>

<p>As neither of the rascals would utter a word, Lieutenant
Parry decided to go aft at once after they had
been secured, and try to get an explanation of how
they came to be in the yacht’s crew. As the party
reached the after deck they found old Mr. Pangloss in
the midst of a long explanation of how the trouble had
come about. They had sailed from Narragansett the
evening before. He meant to cruise down to Southern
waters.</p>

<p>“But the mutiny, sir? What started it?” broke in
Captain McGill impatiently, as the apostle of peace
rambled along.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I believe they must have been after my
daughter’s jewelry. She has $150,000 worth on
board.”</p>

<p>“Permit me to say, sir, then, that I think that you
have used very little judgment in taking such valuables
to sea with you.”</p>

<p>“Just what I told papa,” put in the girl, who had
been standing by the rail with Channing Lockyer, and
seemed to have lost all interest in mutinies, or anything
else.</p>

<p>“B-b-b-but they were in a safe,” stuttered Mr. Pangloss,
looking red and abashed.</p>

<p>“As if that would act as an obstacle, sir,” said Captain
McGill impatiently; “but your captain, where was
he during all this trouble?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, he left me at Narragansett,” rejoined
Mr. Pangloss. “He objected to my refusing to allow
him to put two unruly members of the crew in irons.
I decided to navigate the craft myself down to New
York, where I would ship another skipper.”</p>

<p>“Had you no other officers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a first mate named Gradbarr, and a second
officer named Anderson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Channing Lockyer started forward as he heard the
names.</p>

<p>“Those rascals! Where are they? How did you
get them on board?”</p>

<p>“Why, they applied for berths when we sailed from
New York” rejoined Mr. Pangloss, “and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They are both in irons forward,” Lieutenant Parry
finished for him.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, they are captured,” breathed Mr.
Lockyer; “while they were at large I should never
have drawn an easy breath. I always feared they
would, in some way, harm the submarine.”</p>

<p>“Then they would be attacking the property of the
United States Government, Lockyer,” laughed Captain
McGill; “for I am going to recommend that eighteen
similar craft to that little hooker alongside be
built at once.”</p>

<p>The inventor’s face lit up. But the first person he
turned to was Miss Pangloss. She met his gaze delightedly.
As for the young lady’s father, he looked
fairly staggered.</p>

<p>“I think you told me, Lockyer, that those submarines
could be built for $200,000 apiece?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded the radiant inventor.</p>

<p>“That’s $2,160,000!” gasped the old man.</p>

<p>“Your figures are correct, sir,” said Captain McGill
dryly; “and the nation owning such boats gets
them cheap, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>“Lockyer!” cried the old man, approaching the inventor
with outstretched hand, “I have been unjust to
you in the past. Forgive and forget. For my part,
after what I have seen, I am willing to admit that submarines,
besides being needful in war, have occasions
of usefulness in peace.”</p>

<p>“Their lawful occasions, eh?” quoted Lieutenant
Parry, from the sea service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Lockyer has proved that twice,” put in Mr.
Stark.</p>

<p>“Parry, what’s the nearest harbor? It’s important
that we should land those rascals and the Italians, and
give them into the hands of the police,” said Captain
McGill presently.</p>

<p>“We can make for Stonington, sir,” was the reply.
“There’s Fisher Island light off our port-bow now.”</p>

<p>“Then put us in there. It will be daylight in a short
time,” ordered Captain McGill. “Strong, you, Taylor
and Marlin will remain on board as a prize crew. Mr.
Lockyer,” this with a smile at the inventor and the
girl, “you will also remain to take care of your own
particular prize. Gentlemen, let us re-embark on board
the latest addition to the United States Navy&mdash;the submarine
wonder, the Lockyer.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, as Tom Marlin would say, “the yarn is spun.”
It may be set down here, however, that all concerned
in the mutiny got their just deserts. Although an
effort was made to ascertain from Gradbarr and Anderson
something relating to the whereabouts of Ferriss
and his rascally accomplice, Camberly, nothing
could be got from them, except a vague statement that
both men had gone to the Far East. The Atlas Works
were seized by creditors, and the two submarines found
there sold for junk.</p>

<p>As for Gradbarr and Anderson, they admitted their
object in shipping on board Mr. Pangloss’s yacht was
to evade the police who, they felt sure, must be hot on
their trail after the abduction of Mr. Lockyer and Ned.
Incidentally, they are probably the first criminals ever
brought to justice through the instrumentality of a
submarine boat.</p>

<p>In spick and span uniforms, our friends attended
the wedding of Channing Lockyer and Miss Pangloss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and the speech the former apostle of peace made at the
wedding breakfast astonished and shocked his old admirers;
for it dealt with the necessity of being in constant
preparation for trouble, so that if we did have to
fight, we could fight to win. His resignation was immediately
demanded by half-a-dozen peace societies,
but he stuck to his guns, and the United States Navy
now has no stauncher friend than Peregrine Pangloss.</p>

<p>On the festive day, too, it might have been noticed
that Ned and Herc both wore small, glittering objects
affixed to their uniforms during the ceremony.</p>

<p>These were tiny gold and diamond submarine boats.
On the back of each was an inscription:</p>

<p>“From Channing Lockyer to the Dreadnought Boys,
in partial recognition of the valued services they rendered
him during a trying time.”</p>

<p>Though each had protested, the inventor also insisted
on starting a good, fat bank-account for each
boy, not forgetting Tom Marlin. So that, with what
they already have in the Navy Savings Bank, Ned and
Herc feel, to express it in their own words, “like
bloated millionaires.”</p>

<p>But both lads would gladly give up all their bright
prospects to-morrow if their retention of them depended
on their leaving the service. They would
rather be serving Uncle Sam on the seas than be millionaires
twenty times over. In this Sim Phillips
agrees with them. He is now superintendent of the
busy Lockyer Submarine Boat Works, but he considers
himself quite a part of the Navy, inasmuch as all the
boats the Works turn out are for Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>But modern as the Lockyer is, she doubtless will be
superseded by other and newer craft. Indeed, Mr.
Lockyer is now working on various improvements,
which are to be embodied in his latest invention. “The
old order changes” more frequently in things naval
and military than in almost any other branch of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
While some of the brightest minds in the country
were working on submarine problems, others had been
busy trying to solve the problems of the air.</p>

<p>How the United States Navy experimented with
aerial craft and what part our Dreadnought Boys
played in the interesting, exciting campaign of innovation,
our readers may learn by perusing the next volume
of this series&mdash;a description of thrilling aerial adventures
and perils for the honor of Uncle Sam&mdash;<span class="smcap">The

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
